The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris)[2][3] is a 
subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), a member of 
the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The 
term "domestic dog" is generally used for both 
domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first 
domesticated animal[4][5] and has been the most widely 
kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human 
history.[citation needed] The word "dog" can also refer 
to the male of a canine species,[6] as opposed to the 
word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.
Recent studies of "well-preserved remains of a dog-like 
canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains 
of southern Siberia concluded that a particular instance 
of early wolf domestication approximately 33,000 years 
ago did not result in modern dog lineages, possibly 
because of climate disruption during the Last Glacial 
Maximum.[4][7] The authors postulate that at least 
several such incipient events have occurred. A study of 
fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia 
tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to 
more than 31,700 years ago.[8] Another recent study has 
found support for claims of dog domestication between 
14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with a range between 9,000 
and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate 
assumptions.[9] Dogs' value to early human hunter-
gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across 
world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such 
as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting 
police and military, companionship, and, more recently, 
aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human 
society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" 
in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are 
also a source of meat.[10][11] In 2001, there were 
estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[12]
Most breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, 
having been artificially selected for particular 
morphologies and behaviors by people for specific 
functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the 
dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and 
shows more behavioral and morphological variation than 
any other land mammal.[13] For example, height measured 
to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in 
the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish 
Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually 
called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to 
dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of 
patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to 
wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[14] It is common 
for most breeds to shed this coat.

Etymology and related terminology

Dog is the common use term that refers to members of the 
subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, "dog"; lupus, 
"wolf"; familiaris, "of a household" or "domestic"). The 
term can also be used to refer to a wider range of 
related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, 
or "true dogs", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, 
or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which 
would also include the African wild dog, or it can be 
used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which 
would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and 
others.[15] Some members of the family have dog in their 
common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African 
wild dog. A few animals have dog in their common names 
but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.
The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, 
from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[16] The 
term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkon, 
represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-
muscle").[17] The word also shows the familiar petname 
diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", 
stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[18] 
The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest 
layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the 
role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.[19]
In 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) 
was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog 
referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the 
mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it 
eventually became the prototype of the category 
"hound".[20] By the 16th century, dog had become the 
general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types 
used for hunting.[21] Hound, cognate to German Hund, 
Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic 
hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-
European *kwon- "dog", found in Sanskrit kukuur 
(???????),[22] Welsh ci (plural cwn), Latin canis, Greek 
kýon, and Lithuanian šuõ.[23]
In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a 
dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English 
bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse 
bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of 
a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the 
dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, 
from French poupée, until they are about a year old. The 
process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word 
hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, 
Icelandic hvelpur).[24] The term "whelp" can also be used 
to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat 
archaic) alternative to "puppy".
Taxonomy

In 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, Carl 
Linnaeus, listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar 
to him, the Latin word for dog, canis. Among the species 
within this genus, Linnaeus listed the fox, as Canis 
vulpes, wolves (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, 
(Canis canis). In later editions, Linnaeus dropped Canis 
canis and greatly expanded his list of the Canis genus of 
quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, 
wolves, and jackals and many more terms that are now 
listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including aegyptius 
(hairless dog), aquaticus, (water dog), and mustelinus 
(literally "badger dog"). Among these were two that later 
experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a 
species: Canis domesticus and, most predominantly, Canis 
familiaris, the "common" or "familiar" dog.[25]
The domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own 
right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, 
vocalizations, morphology, and molecular biology led to 
the contemporary scientific understanding that a single 
species, the gray wolf, is the common ancestor for all 
breeds of domestic dogs.[26][27][28] In recognition of 
this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as 
Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf 
Canis lupus, by the Smithsonian Institution and the 
American Society of Mammalogists. C. l. familiaris is 
listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in 
the scientific community and recommended by ITIS, 
although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.[29]
Since that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to 
domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, 
Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and Christian Smith in 
1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed 
as taxonomic synonyms for Canis lupus familiaris.[30]
History and evolution



Domestic dogs are descended from gray wolves.
Main articles: Origin of the domestic dog and Gray wolf
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf 
ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with 
complex body language. These sophisticated forms of 
social cognition and communication may account for their 
trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human 
households and social situations, and these attributes 
have given dogs a relationship with humans that has 
enabled them to become one of the most successful species 
on the planet today.[26]
Although experts largely disagree over the details of dog 
domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played 
a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[31] 
Domestication may have occurred initially in separate 
areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. Currently it is 
thought domestication of our current lineage of dog 
occurred sometime as early as 15,000 years ago and 
arguably as late as 8500 years ago. Shortly after the 
latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human 
populations, and spread throughout the world.
Emigrants from Siberia likely crossed the Bering Strait 
with dogs in their company, and some experts[32] suggest 
the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the 
success of the waves that entered North America roughly 
12,000 years ago,[32] although the earliest 
archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North 
America dates from about 9,400 years ago.[33][34] Dogs 
were an important part of life for the Athabascan 
population in North America, and were their only 
domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load 
in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 
years ago. Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures 
often persisted after the introduction of the horse to 
North America.[35]
The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists 
is that the dating of first domestication is 
indeterminate,[31][35] although more recent evidence 
shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 
years ago.[36][37] There is conclusive evidence the 
present lineage of dogs genetically diverged from their 
wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years 
ago,[38][39][40][41][42] but some believe domestication 
to have occurred earlier.[31] Evidence is accruing that 
there were previous domestication events, but that those 
lineages died out.[43]
It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as 
such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or 
whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a 
different course prior to domestication. For example, it 
is hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the 
campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and 
associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored 
those who were less frightened by, and keener in 
approaching, humans.[44]
The bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of 
the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of 
archaeological findings and mitochondrial DNA studies. 
The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based 
in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the 
domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years 
ago,[26][35] and some genetic evidence indicates the 
domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in 
the late Upper Paleolithic close to the 
Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 
years ago.[45] But there is a wide range of other, 
contradictory findings that make this issue 
controversial.[citation needed] There are findings 
beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly 
placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by 
shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding 
of teeth.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the latest point at 
which dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 
15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged 
much earlier.[26] In 2008, a team of international 
scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet 
Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 
31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, musk ox and 
reindeer.[46]
Prior to this Belgian discovery, the earliest dog bones 
found were two large skulls from Russia and a mandible 
from Germany dated from roughly 14,000 years ago.[26][40] 
Remains of smaller dogs from Natufian cave deposits in 
the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human 
being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 
10,000 to 12,000 years ago.[40][47] There is a great deal 
of archaeological evidence for dogs throughout Europe and 
Asia around this period and through the next two thousand 
years (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years ago), with specimens 
uncovered in Germany, the French Alps, and Iraq, and cave 
paintings in Turkey.[26] The oldest remains of a 
domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and 
have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.[48]
DNA studies


A basenji, one of the earliest domesticated breeds.
DNA studies have provided a wide range of possible 
divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,[40] to 
as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.[49] These 
results depend on a number of assumptions.[26] Genetic 
studies are based on comparisons of genetic diversity 
between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some 
estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an 
estimated wolf–coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 
years ago as a calibration.[50] If this estimate is 
incorrect, and the actual wolf–coyote divergence is 
closer to one or two million years ago, or more,[51] then 
the DNA evidence that supports specific dog–wolf 
divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.
Furthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of 
wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and 
that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by 
selective breeding. This could significantly bias DNA 
analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The 
genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in 
East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. 
These conclusions are based on the location of maximal 
genetic divergence, and assume hybridization does not 
occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. 
Although these assumptions hold for many species, there 
is good reason to believe that they do not hold for 
canines.[26]
Genetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended 
from a handful of domestication events with a small 
number of founding females,[26][45] although there is 
evidence domesticated dogs interbred with local 
populations of wild wolves on several occasions.[40] Data 
suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and 
these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout 
the world, reaching the North American continent around 
8000 BC.[40] The oldest groups of dogs, which show the 
greatest genetic variability and are the most similar to 
their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African 
breeds, including the Basenji, Lhasa Apso, and Siberian 
Husky.[52] Some breeds thought to be very old, such as 
the Pharaoh Hound, Ibizan Hound, and Norwegian Elkhound, 
are now known to have been created more recently.[52]
A great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary 
framework for the domestication of dogs.[26] Although it 
is widely claimed that "man domesticated the wolf,"[53] 
man may not have taken such a proactive role in the 
process.[26] The nature of the interaction between man 
and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and 
controversial. At least three early species of the Homo 
genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years 
ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact 
with canine species.[26]

Despite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of 
canine species to the presence of the close relatives of 
modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, 
roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would 
have coincided with a large expansion in human territory 
and the development of agriculture. This has led some 
biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the 
domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in 
the form of established human settlements. Permanent 
settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of 
disposable food and would have created a barrier between 
wild and anthropogenic canine populations.[26]
In 2013 Thalmann, Krause and coworkers revised the view 
that dog ancestors came from East Asia and showed using 
DNA analysis that "all dogs living today go back to four 
genetic lineages, all of which originate in Europe." [54] 
Their data indicated that bonding between humans and dog 
occurred between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago, likely in 
the context of hunting.[54]

Early roles
Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived 
significant benefits from living in human camps—more 
safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and 
more chance to breed.[55] They would have benefited from 
humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over 
which to see potential predators and prey, as well as 
color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better 
visual discrimination.[55] Camp dogs would also have 
benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down 
larger prey and controlling fire for a range of 
purposes.[55]
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the 
dogs associated with their camps.[56] For instance, dogs 
would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food 
scraps.[56] Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to 
in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" 
(an exceptionally cold night), and they would have 
alerted the camp to the presence of predators or 
strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early 
warning.[56]
Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit 
would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell 
to assist with the hunt.[56] The relationship between the 
presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often 
mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of 
the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and 
without a dog gives quantitative support to the 
hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was 
an important factor in wolf domestication.[57]
The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly 
improved the chances of survival for early human groups, 
and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the 
key forces that led to human success.[58]
As pets

"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs 
between humans and dogs"[56] and the keeping of dogs as 
companions, particularly by elites, has a long 
history.[59] However, pet dog populations grew 
significantly after World War II as suburbanization 
increased.[59] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept 
outside more often than they tend to be today[60] (using 
the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion 
from the group signifies the distance between the 
doghouse and the home) and were still primarily 
functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or 
walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been 
changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased 
role of dogs in the emotional support of their human 
guardians.[61] People and dogs have become increasingly 
integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[62] to 
the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family 
and home are experienced.[63]
There have been two major trends in the changing status 
of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of 
the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of 
personality and behaviour.[63] The second has been the 
broadening of the concept of the family and the home to 
include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and 
practices.[63]
There are a vast range of commodity forms available to 
transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[64] The list 
of goods, services and places available is enormous: from 
dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog 
groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, 
spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and 
cemeteries.[64] While dog training as an organized 
activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the 
last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile 
issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, 
jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine 
marking[further explanation needed] became increasingly 
incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[65] Dog 
training books, classes and television programs 
proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog 
continued.[66]

The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe 
their pet as part of the family,[63] although some 
ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the 
popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a 
pack.[63] A dominance model of dog–human relationships 
has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the 
television program Dog Whisperer. However it has been 
disputed that "trying to achieve status" is 
characteristic of dog–human interactions.[67] Pet dogs 
play an active role in family life; for example, a study 
of conversations in dog–human families showed how family 
members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or 
talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions 
with each other.[68]
Another study of dogs' roles in families showed many dogs 
have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, 
the most common of which was helping with the washing-up 
by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in 
the newspaper from the lawn.[63] Increasingly, human 
family members are engaging in activities centered on the 
perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the 
dog is an integral partner, such as Dog Dancing and 
Doga.[64]
According to the statistics published by the American Pet 
Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet 
Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5 
million people with pet dogs in the United States.[69] 
The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households 
own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% 
two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not 
seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as 
the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and 
male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are 
undergoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of 
the owned dogs come from a shelter.
The latest study using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same 
response of voices and use the same parts of brain as 
humans and made dogs understand of emotional human 
voices, made the dogs as friendly social pets to 
humans.[70]
Work
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles 
that they have earned the unique nickname, "man's best 
friend",[71] a phrase used in other languages as well. 
They have been bred for herding livestock,[72] hunting 
(e.g. pointers and hounds),[73] rodent control,[3] 
guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, 
and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as 
companions.[3] In 1957, a husky-terrier mix named Laika 
became the first animal to orbit the Earth.[74][75]

Service dogs such as guide dogs, utility dogs, assistance 
dogs, hearing dogs, and psychological therapy dogs 
provide assistance to individuals with physical or mental 
disabilities.[76][77] Some dogs owned by epileptics have 
been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows 
signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance 
of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, 
medication, or medical care.[78]
Dogs included in human activities in terms of helping out 
humans are usually called working dogs. Dogs of several 
breeds are considered working dogs. Some working dog 
breeds include Akita, Alaskan Malamute, Anatolian 
Shepherd Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Black Russian 
Terrier, Boxer, Bullmastiff, Doberman Pinscher, Dogue de 
Bordeaux, German Pinscher, German Shepherd,[79] Giant 
Schnauzer, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Great Swiss 
Mountain Dog, Komondor, Kuvasz, Mastiff, Neapolitan 
Mastiff, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water Dog, Rottweiler, 
Saint Bernard, Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Standard 
Schnauzer, and Tibetan Mastiff.
Sports and shows
See also: Conformation show
People often enter their dogs in competitions[80] such as 
breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, 
sledding and agility competitions.
In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a 
judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates 
individual purebred dogs for conformity with their 
established breed type as described in the breed 
standard. As the breed standard only deals with the 
externally observable qualities of the dog (such as 
appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested 
qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the 
judging in conformation shows.
As a food source
Main article: Dog meat


Gaegogi (dog meat) stew being served in a Korean 
restaurant
Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, 
including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that 
dates back to antiquity.[81] It is estimated that 13–16 
million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every 
year.[82] The BBC claims that, in 1999, more than 6,000 
restaurants served soups made from dog meat in South 
Korea.[83] In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for 
meat, the nureongi (???), differs from those breeds 
raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.[84]
The most popular Korean dog dish is gaejang-guk (also 
called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the 
body's heat during the summer months; followers of the 
custom claim this is done to ensure good health by 
balancing one's gi, or vital energy of the body. A 19th 
century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is 
prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili 
powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo 
shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with 
a segment of the population, dog is not as widely 
consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.[85]
A CNN report in China dated March 2010 includes an 
interview with a dog meat vendor who stated that most of 
the dogs that are available for selling to restaurants 
are raised in special farms but that there is always a 
chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although 
dog pet breeds are not considered edible.[86]
Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian 
Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, 
Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern 
cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as 
taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of 
Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—
being good for the lungs for instance.[87] Dog meat is 
also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.[88]

It is estimated that 4.7 million people are bitten by 
dogs each year.[89] In the 1980s and 1990s the US 
averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this 
has increased to 26.[90] 77% of dog bites are from the 
pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the 
property of the dog's legal owner.[90]
A Colorado study found bites in children were less severe 
than bites in adults.[91] The incidence of dog bites in 
the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 
5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, 
children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the 
face or neck.[92] Sharp claws with powerful muscles 
behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead 
to serious infections.[93]
In the UK between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog 
attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost 
in sick leave.[94]
In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more 
than 86,000 falls e

Health benefits for humans

The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether 
companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health 
and psychological wellbeing.[103] Studies suggesting that 
there are benefits to physical health and psychological 
wellbeing[104] have been criticised for being poorly 
controlled,[105] and finding that "[t]he health of 
elderly people is related to their health habits and 
social supports but not to their ownership of, or 
attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have 
shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit 
better mental and physical health than those who do not, 
making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely 
to be on medication than non-guardians.[106]
A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to 
support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated 
with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced 
use of general practitioner services, or any 
psychological or physical benefits on health for 
community dwelling older people. Research has, however, 
pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school 
through sickness among children who live with pets."[103] 
In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant 
reduction in minor health problems during the first month 
following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained 
in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[107]
In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more 
physical exercise than those with cats and those without 
pets. The group without pets exhibited no statistically 
significant changes in health or behaviour. The results 
provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive 
effects on human health and behaviour, and that for 
guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-
term.[107] Pet guardianship has also been associated with 
increased coronary artery disease survival, with human 
guardians being significantly less likely to die within 
one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who 
did not own dogs.[108]

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with 
dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. 
For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people 
show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and 
psychological indicators of anxiety.[109] Other health 
benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating 
microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene 
hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune 
diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include 
social support, as dogs are able to not only provide 
companionship and social support themselves, but also to 
act as facilitators of social interactions between 
humans.[110] One study indicated that wheelchair users 
experience more positive social interactions with 
strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when 
they are not.[111]
The practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of 
therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals 
were introduced into mental institutions to help 
socialize patients with mental disorders.[112] Animal-
assisted intervention research has shown that animal-
assisted therapy with a dog can increase social 
behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people 
with Alzheimer's disease.[113] One study demonstrated 
that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who 
participated in an education program with dogs and other 
animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge 
and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and 
violent behavior compared to those who were not in an 
animal-assisted program.[114]
Shelters
Main article: Animal shelter
Every year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter 
US animal shelters.[115] The Humane Society of the United 
States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million 
of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the 
United States.[116] However, the percentage of dogs in US 
animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed 
from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased 
since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 
40% among reporting shelters[117] (and many shelters 
reporting 60–75%).[118]
Biology

Main article: Dog anatomy


Lateral view of a dog's bone structure.
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia 
for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical 
attributes.[3] Modern dog breeds show more variation in 
size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic 
animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that 
of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.[3] Dogs are 
predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory 
mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, 
a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and 
endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The 
smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that 
stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 
in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 
113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English 
Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm 
(98 in) from the snout to the tail.[119] The tallest dog 
is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the 
shoulder.[120]

Vision


Dog's visual colour perception compared with humans.
Like most mammals, dogs are dichromats and have color 
vision equivalent to red–green color blindness in humans 
(deuteranopia).[121][122][123][124] So, dogs can see blue 
and yellow, but difficult to differentiate red and green 
because dogs only have two spectral types of cones 
photoreceptors, while normal humans have three cones. And 
dogs use color instead of brightness to differentiate 
light or dark blue/yellow.[125] Dogs are less sensitive 
to differences in grey shades than humans and also can 
detect brightness at about half the accuracy of 
humans.[126]
The dog's visual system has evolved to aid proficient 
hunting.[121] While a dog's visual acuity is poor (that 
of a poodle's has been estimated to translate to a 
Snellen rating of 20/75[121]), their visual 
discrimination for moving objects is very high; dogs have 
been shown to be able to discriminate between humans 
(e.g., identifying their human guardian) at a range of 
between 800 and 900 m, however this range decreases to 
500–600 m if the object is stationary.[121]
Dogs have a temporal resolution of between 60 and 70 Hz, 
which explains why many dogs struggle to watch 
television, as most such modern screens are optimized for 
humans at 50–60 Hz.[126] Dogs can detect a change in 
movement that exists in a single diopter of space within 
their eye. Humans, by comparison, require a change of 
between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.[127][128]
As crepuscular hunters, dogs often rely on their vision 
in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a 
high density of rods in the fovea, an increased flicker 
rate, and a tapetum lucidum.[121] The tapetum is a 
reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light 
to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the 
photons. There is also a relationship between body size 
and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6 
mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% 
variance can be substantial and is associated as an 
adaptation toward superior night vision.[129]
The eyes of different breeds of dogs have different 
shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.[130] Many 
long-nosed breeds have a "visual streak"—a wide foveal 
region that runs across the width of the retina and gives 
them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some long-
muzzled breeds, in particular, the sighthounds, have a 
field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). 
Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an "area 
centralis": a central patch with up to three times the 
density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving 
them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some broad-
headed breeds with short noses have a field of vision 
similar to that of humans.[122][123]
Most breeds have good vision, but some show a genetic 
predisposition for myopia – such as Rottweilers, with 
which one out of every two has been found to be 
myopic.[121] Dogs also have a greater divergence of the 
eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their 
pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the 
eye axis of dogs ranges from 12–25° depending on the 
breed.[127]
Experimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish 
between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a 
prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images 
such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own 
reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest 
declines sharply once they are unable to make social 
contact with the image.[131]
Hearing


The physiology of a dog ear.


Transformation of the ears of a huskamute puppy in 6 days
The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz 
to 60,000 Hz,[132] which means that dogs can detect 
sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory 
spectrum.[123][132][133] In addition, dogs have ear 
mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact 
location of a sound.[134] Eighteen or more muscles can 
tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can 
identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, 
as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.[134]
Smell


The wet, textured nose of a dog
While the human brain is dominated by a large visual 
cortex, the dog brain is dominated by an olfactory 
cortex.[121] The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty 
times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative 
to total brain size, with 125 to 220 million smell-
sensitive receptors.[121] The bloodhound exceeds this 
standard with nearly 300 million receptors.[121]
Consequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in 
general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred 
thousand to one million times more sensitive than a 
human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the 
olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater 
than a human's.[135] The wet nose, or rhinarium, is 
essential for determining the direction of the air 
current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin 
are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation 
of the moisture by air currents.[136]
Physical characteristics

Coat
Main article: Coat (dog)

The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" 
being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating 
from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and 
a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.
Domestic dogs often display the remnants of 
countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A 
countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper 
surfaces and light coloring below,[137] which reduces its 
general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an 
occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on 
their chest or underside.[138]
Tail
See also: Docking
There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, 
straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many 
canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is 
to communicate their emotional state, which can be 
important in getting along with others. In some hunting 
dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid 
injuries.[139] In some breeds, such as the Braque du 
Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no 
tail at all.[140]
Types and breeds
Main article: Dog breed

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels demonstrate with-breed 
variation.
While all dogs are genetically very similar,[40] natural 
selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain 
characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving 
rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad 
categories based on function, genetics, or 
characteristics.[141] Dog breeds are groups of animals 
that possess a set of inherited characteristics that 
distinguishes them from other animals within the same 
species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific 
classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.
Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically 
distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds,[52] 
but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is 
unsystematic. Systematic analyses of the dog genome has 
revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said 
to be statistically distinct.[52] These include the "old 
world dogs" (e.g., Malamute and Shar Pei), "Mastiff"-type 
(e.g., English Mastiff), "herding"-type (e.g., Border 
Collie), and "all others" (also called "modern"- or 
"hunting"-type).[52][142]
Health
Main articles: Dog health and CVBD
Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and 
poisons, some of which can affect humans. To defend 
against many common diseases, dogs are often vaccinated.
There are many household plants that are poisonous to 
dogs, such as poinsettias, begonia and aloe vera.[143]
Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments 
such as elbow or hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, 
pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two 
serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs 
are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and 
ages, and bloat, which affects the larger breeds or deep-
chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can 
kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such 
as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworm, 
tapeworm, roundworm, and heartworm.
Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, 
typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is 
toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is 
capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so 
slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, 
especially dark chocolate.
Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health 
conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and 
heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and 
arthritis.[144]
Mortality

Main article: Aging in dogs
The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, 
but for most the median longevity, the age at which half 
the dogs in a population have died and half are still 
alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[145][146][147][148] 
Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their 
breed.
The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for 
which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable 
sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median 
longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, 
including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish 
Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median 
longevities of 6 to 7 years.[148]
The longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese 
Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median 
longevities of 14 to 15 years.[148] The median longevity 
of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is 
one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when 
all breeds are averaged.[146][147][148][149] The dog 
widely reported to be the longest-lived is "Bluey", who 
died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the 
time of his death; however, the Bluey record is anecdotal 
and unverified.[150] On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the 
world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of 
World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.[151]
Predation
Although wild dogs, like wolves, are apex predators, they 
can be killed in territory disputes with wild 
animals.[152] Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and 
other large predators live, dogs can be a major food 
source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia 
indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill 
sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog 
populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been 
paid for dog losses than livestock.[152] Some wolf pairs 
have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf 
lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal 
waits in ambush.[153] In some instances, wolves have 
displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and 
buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that 
they[which?] have to be beaten off or killed.[154]
Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. 
Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection 
for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them 
regardless of the dog's size or ferocity.[155] Tigers in 
Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed 
to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.[156] 
Striped Hyenas are major predators of village dogs in 
Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.[157] Reptiles such 
as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat 
dogs.
Diet

Despite their descent from wolves and classification as 
Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and 
other writings as carnivores[158][159] or 
omnivores.[3][160][161][162] Unlike obligate carnivores, 
such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, 
dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not 
dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level 
of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary 
requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of 
foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a 
large proportion of these in their diet.[3] Compared to 
their wolf ancestors, dogs have adaptations in genes 
involved in starch digestion that contribute to an 
increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[163]
Foods toxic to dogs

(September 2013)
Click [show] on the right to read important instructions 
before translating.[show]
A number of common human foods and household ingestibles 
are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids 
(theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, 
sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[164] grapes and 
raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[165] as well as various 
plants and other potentially ingested 
materials.[166][167] The nicotine in tobacco can also be 
dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or 
ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be 
vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) 
or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of 
coordination, collapse, or death. To solve, soothe the 
stomach irritation by giving charcoal tablets. For severe 
signs, get immediate veterinary attention. [168]
Reproduction
Main article: Canine reproduction
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around 
age six to twelve months for both males and 
females,[3][169] although this can be delayed until up to 
two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at 
which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. 
They will experience subsequent estrous cycles 
biannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. 
At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, 
being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.[3] 
Because the ova survive and are capable of being 
fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for 
a female to mate with more than one male.[3]
2–5 days post conception fertilization occurs, 14–16 days 
embryo attaches to uterus 22–23 days heart beat is 
detectable.[170][171]
Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after 
fertilization,[3][172] with an average of 63 days, 
although the length of gestation can vary. An average 
litter consists of about six puppies,[173] though this 
number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In 
general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in 
each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many 
as twelve.
Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective 
breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French 
Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the 
female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be 
artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.[174]
Neutering

Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually 
by removal of the male's testicles or the female's 
ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to 
procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the 
overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal 
control agencies, such as the American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that 
dogs not intended for further breeding should be 
neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that 
may have to later be euthanized.[175]
According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3–4 
million dogs and cats are put down each year in the 
United States and many more are confined to cages in 
shelters because there are many more animals than there 
are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep 
overpopulation down.[176] Local humane societies, SPCAs, 
and other animal protection organizations urge people to 
neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters 
instead of purchasing them.
Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, 
especially in male dogs.[177] Spayed female dogs are less 
likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary 
glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[178] 
However, neutering increases the risk of urinary 
incontinence in female dogs,[179] and prostate cancer in 
males,[180] as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, 
cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus 
in either sex.[181]
Communication
By the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the 
majority of its vocalizations.[182] The dog is the most 
vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in a 
myriad of situations.[182]
Barking appears to have little more communication 
functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a 
human, or simply because other dogs are barking.[182] 
Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial 
movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the 
main sources of actual communication.[182] The majority 
of these subtle communication techniques are employed at 
a close proximity to another, but for long-range 
communication only barking and howling are employed.[182]
Intelligence and behavior

Intelligence
Main article: Dog intelligence


The Border Collie is considered to be one of the most 
intelligent breeds.[183]
The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social 
intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.[121] 
Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as 
through simple reinforcement (e.g., classical or operant 
conditioning) and by observation.[121]
Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive 
development. As with humans, the understanding that 
objects not being actively perceived still remain in 
existence (called object permanence) is not present at 
birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact 
intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks 
of age.[121]
Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set 
by experienced dogs.[121] This form of intelligence is 
not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to 
perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract 
problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an 
experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached 
piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the 
cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those 
left to solve the problem on their own.[121][184]
Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one 
study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, 
when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of 
the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with 
the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were 
then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three 
quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, 
and over half successfully released the ball, compared to 
only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human 
manipulate the lever.[185] Another study found that 
handing an object between experimenters who then used the 
object's name in a sentence successfully taught an 
observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to 
subsequently retrieve the item.[186]

participated in four offensives and 17 battles.
Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated social cognition by 
associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.[121] 
One such class of social cognition involves the 
understanding that others are conscious agents. Research 
has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle 
social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or 
dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, 
researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden 
underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then 
attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the 
location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: 
tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to 
the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.[187] The 
results showed that domestic dogs were better than 
chimpanzees, wolves, and human infants at this task, and 
even young puppies with limited exposure to humans 
performed well.[121]
Psychology research has shown that humans' gaze 
instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the 
right side of a person's face, which is related to use of 
right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including 
human facial emotions. Research at the University of 
Lincoln (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when 
meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human 
being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such 
they are the only non-primate species known to do 
so.[188][189]
Stanley Coren, an expert on dog psychology, states that 
these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs 
can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, 
and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition 
that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the 
wolf.[121] Studies have also investigated whether dogs 
engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending 
on the attention-state of their partner.[190] Those 
studies showed that play signals were only sent when the 
dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the 
partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in 
attention-getting behavior before sending a play 
signal.[190]
Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a 
sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, 
which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including 
one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting 
on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the 
room.[121] Although this could have been accidental, 
Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's 
owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of 
view. Together, the empirical data and anecdotal evidence 
points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of 
theory of mind.[121][190] Similar research has been 
performed by Brian Hare of Duke University, who has shown 
that dogs outperform both great apes as well as wolves 
raised by humans in reading human communicative 
signals.[191][192]
A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when 
separated from others.[193]
A border collie named Chaser has learned the names for 
1,022 toys after three years of training, so many that 
her trainers have had to mark the names of the objects 
lest they forget themselves. This is higher than Rico, 
another border collie who could remember at least 200 
objects.[194]
Behavior
Main article: Dog behavior
Although dogs have been the subject of a great deal of 
behaviorist psychology (e.g. Pavlov's dog), they do not 
enter the world with a psychological "blank slate".[121] 
Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as 
well as environmental factors.[121] Domestic dogs exhibit 
a number of behaviors and predispositions that were 
inherited from wolves.[121]
The Gray Wolf is a social animal that has evolved a 
sophisticated means of communication and social 
structure. The domestic dog has inherited some of these 
predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics 
in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective 
breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, 
such as the dog's highly developed social cognition, are 
found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.[187]


Properly socialized dogs can interact with unfamiliar 
dogs of any size and shape and understand how to 
communicate.
The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs 
have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) 
and five consistent and stable "narrow traits" 
identified, described as playfulness, 
curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and 
aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness–
boldness was also identified.[195][196]
The average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours 
per day.[197] Like humans, dogs have two main types of 
sleep: Slow-wave sleep, then Rapid eye movement sleep, 
the state in which dreams occur.[198]
Dogs prefer, when they are off the leash and Earth's 
magnetic field is calm, to urinate and defecate with 
their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.[199]
Dog growl
A new study in Budapest, Hungary, has found that dogs are 
able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to 
its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect 
their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie 
about their size, and this is the first time research has 
shown animals can determine another's size by the sound 
it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, 
showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result 
showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of 
the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it 
longest.[200]
Differences from wolves



Some dogs, like this Tamaskan Dog, look very much like 
wolves.
Physical characteristics
Further information: Wolf
Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% 
smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,[201] as well as 
proportionately smaller teeth than other canid 
species.[202] Dogs require fewer calories to function 
than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the 
dog's limp ears are a result of atrophy of the jaw 
muscles.[202] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be 
thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes 
favoring the former for use as clothing due to its 
greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh 
weather.[202]
Behavioral differences
Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at observational 
learning, being more responsive to instrumental 
conditioning.[202] Feral dogs show little of the complex 
social structure or dominance hierarchy present in wolf 
packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha 
pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members 
to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a 
dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For 
dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in 
locating food items, and are more like competitors.[202]
Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing 
that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor ungulate 
hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations 
where they are sympatric. However, feral dogs have been 
reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the 
Galápagos Islands,[203] and free ranging pet dogs are 
more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.
Domestic dogs can be monogamous.[204] Breeding in feral 
packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a 
dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf 
packs).[205] Male dogs are unusual among canids by the 
fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising 
their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females 
to increase their own reproductive success.[203] Some 
sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other 
large canid species by the fact that they do not 
regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other 
dogs in the same territory.[202]
However, this difference was not observed in all domestic 
dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young 
as well as care for the young by the males has been 
observed in domestic dogs, dingos as well as in other 
feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the 
females and direct choosing of only one mate has been 
observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic 
dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has 
been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.[204][206]
Trainability
Dogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, 
and are, in general, much more responsive to coercive 
techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force 
than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive 
conditioning and rewards.[207] Unlike tame wolves, dogs 
tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.[208]

Mythology
See also category: Mythological dogs
In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as 
watchdogs.[209]
In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog 
who guards the gates of Hades.[209] In Norse mythology, a 
bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim.[209] 
In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the 
Chinvat Bridge.[209] In Philippine mythology, Kimat who 
is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible 
for lightning. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by 
Cwn Annwn.[209]
In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death owns two watch 
dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the 
gates of Naraka.[210]
In Judaism and Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean 
scavengers.[209] In Christianity, dogs represent 
faithfulness.[209] In Asian countries such as China, 
Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind 
protectors.[209] The role of the dog in Chinese mythology 
includes a position as one of the twelve animals which 
cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog).
