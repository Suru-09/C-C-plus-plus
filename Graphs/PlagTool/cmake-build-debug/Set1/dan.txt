
Tom is my cat.  It has a pair of blue round eyes, 
two pairs of bright pink paws and a light pink nose. My cat is fluffy.
 He is my favorite cat of all.
Tom loves it when I pat him on his back.Tom  loves to drink milk. 
It also likes to eat fish. It sleeps during the afternoon and 
hunts for mice during the night. 
 Our house has no more mice. Tom cat has caught them all !
I feel happy with my cat.
