My cat, Mimi is very interesting and she is fun to watch. 
I love my Mimi so much I would do anything for her.

Mimi is multi-colored, dark and light brown, black, gray, 
and white. The colors are in no particular pattern, though. 
They are just scattered everywhere and I think that it 
is very pretty. She has dark green eyes, but sometimes they 
change colors and are blue. On Mimi's stomach and chin she 
is completely white. That is my favorite part of her because 
it is so soft, warm, and beautiful. Her legs are also white 
and her paws are black and white.
I think that this mixture of colors is very beautiful.
