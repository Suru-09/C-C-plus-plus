I have a pet dog named Rocky.It belongs 
to the Dobermann Pinscher breed. It is 
black in colour with a shade of golden fur 
on its neck and chest.It was only 1 month 
old when Dad brought it home.The first time 
I saw it , I was just thrilled with joy.It 
looked like a soft black ball 
and was so cute.The bonding that developed 
there has since then,continued unbroken.
