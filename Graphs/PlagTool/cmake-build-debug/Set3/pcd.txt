Range of Parrots, all species (red)
Parrots, also known as psittacines /'s?t?sa?nz/,[2][3] are birds of the roughly 372 species in 86 genera that make 
up the order Psittaciformes,[4] found in most tropical and subtropicalregions. The order is subdivided into three 
superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ('true' parrots), theCacatuoidea (cockatoos) and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand 
parrots).[5] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in 
theSouthern Hemisphere as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America andAustralasia.
Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and 
clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. The plumage of 
cockatoos ranges from mostly white to mostly black, with a mobile crest of feathers on the tops of their heads. 
Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism. They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of 
length.
The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds and other plant material. A few 
species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories andlorikeets are specialised for feeding 
on floral nectar and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest intree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay 
white eggs from which hatch altricial(helpless) young.
Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some 
species to imitate human voices enhances their popularity as pets.Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well 
as hunting, habitat loss and competition frominvasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots 
being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds.[6] Measures taken to conserve the habitats of 
some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the 
same ecosystems.[7]

Taxonomy[edit]
Origins and evolution[edit]

Psittaciform diversity in South America and Australasia suggests that the order may have evolved 
in Gondwanaland, centred in Australasia.[8] The scarcity of parrots in the fossil record, however, presents 
difficulties in supporting the hypothesis.
A single 15 mm (0.6 in) fragment from a large lower bill (UCMP 143274), found in deposits from the Lance 
Creek Formation in Niobrara County, Wyoming, had been thought to be the oldest parrot fossil and is presumed 
to have originated from the Late Cretaceous period, which makes it about 70 Ma (million years ago).[9] Other 
studies suggest that this fossil is not from a bird, but from a caenagnathid theropod or a non-avian dinosaur with 
a birdlikebeak.[10][11]
It is now generally assumed that the Psittaciformes, or their common ancestors with several related bird orders, 
were present somewhere in the world around the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (K-Pg extinction), some 
66 Ma If so, they probably had not evolved theirmorphological autapomorphies yet, but were 
generalised arboreal birds, roughly similar (though not necessarily closely related) to 
today's potoos or frogmouths (see alsoPalaeopsittacus below). Though these birds (Cypselomorphae) are a 
phylogenetically challenging group, they seem at least closer to the parrot ancestors than, for example, the 
modern aquatic birds (Aequornithes). The combined evidence supported the hypothesis of Psittaciformes being 
"near passerines", i.e. the mostly land-living birds that emerged in close proximity to the K-Pg extinction. 
Indeed, analysis of transposable element insertions observed in the genomes of passerines and parrots, but not in 
the genomes of other birds, provides strong evidence that parrots are the sister group of passerines, forming a 
cladePsittacopasserae, to the exclusion of the next closest group, the falcons.[12]
Europe is the origin of the first undeniable parrot fossils, which date from about 50 Ma. The climate there and 
then was tropical, consistent with the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. Initially, 
a neoavian named Mopsitta tanta, uncovered in Denmark's Early Eocene Fur Formation and dated to 54 Ma, was 
assigned to the Psittaciformes; it was described from a single humerus.[13] However, the rather nondescript bone 
is not unequivocally psittaciform, and more recently it was pointed out that it may rather belong to a newly 
discovered ibis of the genus Rhynchaeites, whose fossil legs were found in the same deposits.

Fossils assignable to Psittaciformes (though not yet the present-day parrots) date from slightly later in 
the Eocene, starting around 50 Ma. Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like birds have been found 
in England and Germany.[14] Some uncertainty remains, but on the whole it seems more likely that these are not 
direct ancestors of the modern parrots, but related lineages which evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and have 
since died out. These are probably not "missing links" between ancestral and modern parrots, but rather 
psittaciform lineages that evolved parallel to true parrots and cockatoos and had their own peculiar 
autapomorphies:
*	Psittacopes (Early/Middle Eocene of Geiseltal, Germany)-basal[citation needed]
*	Serudaptus-pseudasturid or psittacid[citation needed]
*	Pseudasturidae (Halcyornithidae may be correct name)
*	Pseudasturides - formerly Pseudastur
*	Vastanavidae
*	Vastanavis (Early Eocene of Vastan, India)
*	Quercypsittidae
*	Quercypsitta (Late Eocene)
The earliest records of modern parrots date to about 23-20 Ma and are also from Europe. Subsequently, the fossil 
record-again mainly from Europe-consists of bones clearly recognisable as belonging to parrots of modern 
type. The Southern Hemisphere does not have nearly as rich a fossil record for the period of interest as the 
Northern, and contains no known parrot-like remains earlier than the early to middle Miocene, around 20 Ma. At 
this point, however, is found the first unambiguous parrot fossil (as opposed to a parrot-like one), an upper jaw 
which is indistinguishable from that of modern cockatoos. A few modern genera are tentatively dated to a 
Miocene origin, but their unequivocal record stretches back only some 5 million years (see genus articles for 
more).

The named fossil genera of parrots are probably all in the Psittacidae or close to its ancestry:
*	Archaeopsittacus (Late Oligocene/Early Miocene)
*	Xenopsitta (Early Miocene of Czechia)
*	Psittacidae gen. et spp. indet. (Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand)-several 
species
*	Bavaripsitta (Middle Miocene of Steinberg, Germany)
*	Psittacidae gen. et sp. indet. (Middle Miocene of France)-erroneously placed inPararallus dispar, 
includes "Psittacus" lartetianus
Some Paleogene fossils are not unequivocally accepted to be of psittaciforms:
*	Palaeopsittacus (Early - Middle Eocene of NW Europe)-caprimulgiform (podargid)[citation needed] or 
quercypsittid[citation needed]
*	"Precursor" (Early Eocene)-part of this apparent chimera seems to be of a pseudasturid or psittacid
*	Pulchrapollia (Early Eocene)-includes "Primobucco" olsoni-psittaciform (pseudasturid or 
psittacid)[citation needed]
Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 Ma (range 66-51 Ma) in Gondwanaland.[15] The 
three major clades of Neotropical parrots originated about 50 Ma (range 57-41 Ma).

Phylogenetic relationship between the three parrot 
superfamilies based on the available literature[8][16][17]
The Psittaciformes comprise three main lineages: Strigopoidea, Psittacoidea andCacatuoidea.
The Strigopoidea were considered part of the Psittacoidea, but recent studies place this group of New Zealand 
species at the base of the parrot tree next to the remaining members of the Psittacoidea as well as all members of 
the Cacatuoidea.[8][16][17]
The Cacatuoidea are quite distinct, having a movable head crest, a different arrangement of the carotid arteries, 
a gall bladder, differences in the skull bones, and lack the Dyck texture feathers which, in the Psittacidae, scatters 
light in such a way as to produce the vibrant colours of so many parrots. Colourful feathers with high levels 
of psittacofulvin resist the feather-degrading bacterium Bacillus licheniformis better than white ones.[18]
Lorikeets were previously regarded as a third family, Loriidae,[19] but are now considered a tribe (Loriini) within 
the subfamily Lorinae. The two other tribes in the subfamily are the closely related fig parrots (two genera in the 
tribe Cyclopsittini) and Budgerigar (tribe Melopsittacini).[8][16][17]
Systematics[edit]
The following classification is based on the most recent proposal, which in turn is based on all the relevant recent 
findings.[5][8][16][20][21][22][23]

Morphology[edit]

Extant species range in size from the Buff-faced Pygmy Parrot, at under 10 g (0.4 oz) in weight and 8 cm (3.1 in) 
in length, to the Hyacinth Macaw, at 1 m (3.3 ft) in length, and theKakapo, at 4.0 kg (8.8 lb) in weight. Among 
the superfamilies, the three extant Strigopoideaspecies are all large parrots, and the cockatoos tend to be large 
birds as well. The Psittacoidea parrots are far more variable, ranging the full spectrum of sizes shown by the 
family.
The most obvious physical characteristic is the strong, curved, broad bill. The upper mandible is prominent, 
curves downward, and comes to a point. It is not fused to the skull, which allows it to move independently, and 
contributes to the tremendous biting pressure the birds are able to exert. The lower mandible is shorter, with a 
sharp, upward-facing cutting edge, which moves against the flat portion of the upper mandible in an anvil-like 
fashion. There are touch receptors along the inner edges of the kerantinised bill, which are collectively known as 
the 'bill tip organ', allowing for highly dextrous manipulations. Seed-eating parrots have a strong tongue 
(containing similar touch receptors to those in the bill tip organ), which helps to manipulate seeds or position 
nuts in the bill so that the mandibles can apply an appropriate cracking force. The head is large, with eyes 
positioned high and laterally in the skull, so the visual field of parrots are unlike any other birds. Without turning 
its head, a parrot can see from just below its bill tip, all above its head, and to quite far behind its head. Parrots 
also have quite a wide frontal binocular field for a bird, although this is nowhere near as large as primate 
binocular visual fields.[24]
Parrots have strong zygodactyl feet with sharp, elongated claws, which are used for climbing and swinging. Most 
species are capable of using their feet to manipulate food and other objects with a high degree of dexterity, in a 
similar manner to a human using his hands. A study conducted with Australian parrots has demonstrated that 
they exhibit "handedness"-that is a distinct preference with regards to the foot used to pick up food, with adult 
parrots being almost exclusively "left-footed" or "right footed", and with the prevalence of each preference 
within the population varying from species to species.[25]
Cockatoo species have a mobile crest of feathers on the top of their heads which can be raised for display, and 
retracted. No other parrots can do so, but the Pacific lorikeets in the genera Vini and Phigys are able to ruffle the 
feathers of the crown and nape and theRed-fan Parrot (or Hawk-headed Parrot) has a prominent feather neck 
frill which can be raised and lowered at will. The predominant colour of plumage in parrots is green, though most 
species have some red or another colour in small quantities. Cockatoos are the main exception to this, having lost 
the green and blue plumage colours in their evolutionary history they are now predominately black or white with 
some red, pink or yellow. Strong sexual dimorphism in plumage is not typical among parrots, with some notable 
exceptions, the most striking being the Eclectus Parrot.
Distribution and habitat[edit]
 
 
Most parrot species are tropical but a few species, like this Austral Parakeet, range deeply into temperate zones
See also: List of Psittaciformes by population
Parrots are found on all tropical and subtropical continents including Australia and Oceania,South 
Asia, Southeast Asia, Central America, South America and Africa. Some Caribbean and Pacific islands are home 
to endemic species. By far the greatest number of parrot species come from Australasia and South America. The 
lories and lorikeets range fromSulawesi and the Philippines in the north to Australia and across the Pacific as far 
as French Polynesia, with the greatest diversity being found in and around New Guinea. The 
subfamilyArinae encompasses all the Neotropical parrots, including the Amazons, macaws and conures, and 
ranges from northern Mexico and the Bahamas to Tierra del Fuego in the southern tip of South America. The 
pygmy parrots, tribe Micropsittini, form a small genus restricted to New Guinea. The superfamily Strigopoidea 
contains three living species of aberrant parrots from New Zealand. The broad-tailed parrots, 
subfamily Platycercinae, are restricted to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands as far eastwards as Fiji. 
The true parrot superfamily, Psittacoidea, includes a range of species from Australia and New Guinea to South 
Asia and Africa. The centre of cockatoo biodiversity is Australia and New Guinea, although some species reach 
the Solomon Islands (and one formerly occurred inNew Caledonia),[26] Wallacea and the Philippines.
Several parrots inhabit the cool, temperate regions of South America and New Zealand. One, the Carolina 
Parakeet, lived in temperate North America, but was hunted to extinction in the early 20th century. Many parrots 
have been introduced to areas with temperate climates, and have established stable populations in parts of 
the United States (including New York City),[27] the United Kingdom,[28]Belgium[29] and Spain,[30][31] as well as 
in Greece.[32][33]
Few parrots are wholly sedentary or fully migratory. Most fall somewhere between the two extremes, making 
poorly understood regional movements, with some adopting an entirely nomadic lifestyle.[34]
Behaviour[edit]
There are numerous challenges in studying wild parrots, as they are difficult to catch and once caught they are 
difficult to mark. Most wild bird studies rely on banding or wing tagging, but parrots chew off such 
attachments.[34] Parrots also tend to range widely and consequently there are many gaps in knowledge of their 
behaviour. Some parrots have a strong, direct flight. Most species spend much of their time perched or climbing 
in tree canopies. They often use their bills for climbing by gripping or hooking on branches and other supports. 
On the ground parrots often walk with a rolling gait.
Diet[edit]

The diet of parrots consists of seeds, fruit, nectar, pollen, buds, and sometimes arthropods and other animal prey. 
The most important of these for most true parrots and cockatoos are seeds; the evolution of the large and 
powerful bill can be explained primarily as an adaptation to opening and consuming seeds. All true 
parrots except the Pesquet's Parrot employ the same method to obtain the seed from the husk; the seed is held 
between the mandibles and the lower mandible crushes the husk, whereupon the seed is rotated in the bill and the 
remaining husk is removed.[34] A foot is sometimes used to help holding large seeds in place. Parrots are 
seed predators rather than seed dispersers; and in many cases where species are recorded as consuming fruit they 
are only eating the fruit to get at the seed. As seeds often have poisons to protect them, parrots are careful to 
remove seed coats and other fruit parts which are chemically well defended, prior to ingestion. Many species in 
the Americas, Africa, and Papua New Guinea consume clay which both releases minerals and absorbs toxic 
compounds from the gut.[35]

The lories and lorikeets, hanging parrots and Swift Parrot are primarily nectar and pollen consumers, and 
have tongues with brush tips to collect this source of food, as well as some specialised gut adaptations to 
accommodate this diet.[36] Many other species also consume nectar as well when it becomes available.
In addition to feeding on seeds and flowers, some parrot species prey on animals, especially invertebrate 
larvae. Golden-winged Parakeets prey on water snails, and famously the Keas of New Zealand kill 
juvenile petrels and even attack and indirectly kill adult sheep.[37] Another New Zealand parrot, the Antipodes 
Parakeet, enters the burrows of nesting Grey-backed Storm Petrels and kills the incubating 
adults.[38] Somecockatoos and the Kaka excavate branches and wood to obtain grubs; the bulk of theYellow-
tailed Black Cockatoo's diet is made up of insects.[39]
Breeding[edit]
Although there are a few exceptions, parrots are monogamous breeders which nest in cavities and hold 
no territories other than their nesting sites.[34][40] The pair bonds of the parrots and cockatoos are strong and a pair 
remains close even during the non-breeding season, even if they join larger flocks. As with many birds, pair bond 
formation is preceded by courtship displays; these are relatively simple in the case of cockatoos. In Psittacidae 
parrots common breeding displays, usually undertaken by the male, include slow deliberate steps known as a 
"parade" or "stately walk" and the "eye-blaze", where the pupil of the eye constricts to reveal the edge of the 
iris.[34] Allopreening is used by the pair to help maintain the bond. Cooperative breeding, where birds other than 
the breeding pair help the pair raise the young and is common in some bird families, is extremely rare in parrots, 
and has only unambiguously been demonstrated in the Golden Parakeet (which may also exhibitpolyamorous, or 
group breeding, behaviour with multiple females contributing to the clutch).[41]
 
 
The vast majority of parrots are, like this feral Rose-ringed Parakeet, cavity nesters.
Only the Monk Parakeet and five species of Agapornis lovebird build nests in trees,[42] and three Australian and 
New Zealand ground parrots nest on the ground. All other parrots and cockatoos nest in cavities, either tree 
hollows or cavities dug into cliffs, banks or the ground. The use of holes in cliffs is more common in the 
Americas. Many species use termite nests, possibly to reduce the conspicuousness of the nesting site or to create 
a favourablemicroclimate.[43] In most cases both parents participate in the nest excavation. The length of the 
burrow varies with species, but is usually between 0.5-2 m (1.6-6.6 ft) in length. The nests of cockatoos are 
often lined with sticks, wood chips and other plant material. In the larger species of parrot and cockatoo the 
availability of nesting hollows may be limited, leading to intense competition for them both within the species 
and between species, as well as with other bird families. The intensity of this competition can limit breeding 
success in some cases.[44][45] Some species are colonial, with the Burrowing Parrot nesting in colonies up to 
70,000 strong.[46] Coloniality is not as common in parrots as might be expected, possibly because most species 
adopt old cavities rather than excavate their own.[47]
The eggs of parrots are white. In most species the female undertakes all the incubation, although incubation is 
shared in cockatoos, theBlue Lorikeet, and the Vernal Hanging Parrot. The female remains in the nest for almost 
all of the incubation period and is fed both by the male and during short breaks. Incubation varies from 17 to 35 
days, with larger species having longer incubation periods. The newly born young are altricial, either lacking 
feathers or with sparse white down. The young spend anything from three weeks to four months in the nest, 
depending on species, and may receive parental care for several months thereafter.[48]
As typical of K-selected species, the macaws and other larger parrot species have low reproductive rates. They 
require several years to reach maturity, produce one or very few young per year, and do not necessarily breed 
every year.
Intelligence and learning[edit]
 
 
Sun Conure demonstrating parrots' puzzle-solving skills
Studies with captive birds have given insight into which birds are the most intelligent. While parrots are able to 
mimic human speech, studies with the African Grey Parrot have shown that some are able to associate words 
with their meanings and form simple sentences (seeAlex and N'kisi). Along with crows, ravens, 
and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of 
psittacines and corvines is actually comparable to that of higher primates.[49] One argument against the supposed 
intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is the part of the 
brain considered to be the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the 
brain, the medio-rostral HVC, as the seat of their intelligence. Research has shown that these species tend to have 
the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who 
studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in 
humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using 
ability, but some species of parrot such as the Kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.[50]
Learning in early life is apparently important to all parrots, and much of that learning is social learning. Social 
interactions are often practised with siblings, and in several species creches are formed with several broods, and 
these as well are important for learning social skills. Foraging behaviour is generally learnt from parents, and can 
be a very protracted affair. Supra-generalists and specialists are generally independent of their parents much 
quicker than partly specialised species which may have to learn skills over a long period of time as various 
resources become seasonally available. Play forms a large part of learning in parrots; it can be solitary, and 
related to motor skills, or social. Species may engage in play fights or wild flights to practice predator evasion. 
An absence of stimuli can retard the development of young birds, as demonstrated by a group of Vasa 
Parrots kept in tiny cages with domesticated chickens from the age of 3 months; at 9 months these birds still 
behaved in the same way as 3-month-olds, but had adopted some chicken behaviour.[34] In a similar fashion 
captive birds in zoo collections or pets can, if deprived of stimuli, develop stereotyped behaviours and harmful 
behaviours like self plucking. Aviculturists working with parrots have identified the need for environmental 
enrichment to keep parrots stimulated.
Sound imitation and speech[edit]
Main article: Talking bird
See also: Animal language

Many parrots can imitate human speech or other sounds. A study by Irene Pepperbergsuggested a high learning 
ability in an African Grey Parrot named Alex. Alex was trained to use words to identify objects, describe them, 
count them, and even answer complex questions such as "How many red squares?" with over 80% 
accuracy. N'kisi, another African grey, has been shown to have a vocabulary of approximately a thousand words, 
and has displayed an ability to invent as well as use words in context and in the correct tense.
Parrots do not have vocal cords, so sound is accomplished by expelling air across the mouth of the bifurcated 
trachea. Different sounds are produced by changing the depth and shape of trachea. African Grey Parrots of all 
subspecies are known for their superior ability to imitate sounds and human speech. This ability has made them 
prized as pets from ancient time to the present. In the Masnavi, a writing by Rumi of Persia, AD 1250, the author 
talks about an ancient method for training parrots to speak.
Although most parrot species are able to imitate, some of the Amazon parrots are generally regarded as the next-
best imitators and speakers of the parrot world. The question of why birds imitate remains open, but those that do 
often score very high on tests designed to measure problem solving ability. Wild African Grey Parrots have been 
observed imitating other birds.[51] Most other wild parrots have not been observed imitating other species.
Cooperation[edit]
The journal Animal Cognition stated that some birds preferred to work alone, while others like to work together 
as with African Grey Parrots. With two parrots, they know the order of tasks or when they should do something 
together at once, but they have trouble exchanging roles. With three parrots, one parrot usually prefers to 
cooperate with one of the other two, but all of them are cooperating to solve the task.[52]
Relationship with humans[edit]

Humans and parrots have a complicated relationship. Economically they can be beneficial to communities as 
sources of income from the pet trade and are highly marketable tourism draws and symbols. But some species are 
also economically important pests, particularly some cockatoo species in Australia. Some parrots have also 
benefited from human changes to the environment in some instances, and have expanded their ranges alongside 
agricultural activity, but many species have declined as well.
There exist a number of careers and professions devoted to parrots. Zoos and aquariums employ keepers to care 
for and shape the behaviour of parrots. Some veterinarians who specialise in avian medicine treat parrots 
exclusively. Biologists study parrot populations in the wild and help to conserve wild populations. Aviculturalists 
breed and sell parrots for the pet trade.
Tens of millions of parrots have been removed from the wild, and parrots have been traded in greater numbers 
and for far longer than any other group of wild animals.[53] Many parrot species are still threatened by this trade 
as well as habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and hunting for food or feathers. Some parrot species are 
agricultural pests,[54] eating fruits, grains, and other crops, but parrots can also benefit economies 
through birdwatching based ecotourism.[55]
Pets[edit]

Parrots do not make good pets for most people because of their natural wild instincts such as screaming and 
chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, once mature, they often become 
aggressive and may bite, causing serious injury, partly due to mishandling and poor training. For this reason, 
parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed at least five homes before reaching 
their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. 
Sadly, the parrot's ability to mimic human words and their bright colors and beauty prompt impulse buying from 
unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated Budgerigar, a small parrot, is the most popular of all pet bird species 
and the most discarded. In 1992 the newspaper USA Today published that there were 11 million pet birds in the 
United States alone,[56] many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the Rose-ringed 
Parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the 
Elder.[57] As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often 
been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl discusses in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that 
some importers allowed parrots to drink only coffee while they were being shipped by boat considering pure 
water to be detrimental and believing that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. (Nowadays 
it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.)
Pet parrots may be kept in a cage or aviary; though generally, tame parrots should be allowed out regularly on a 
stand or gym. Depending on locality, parrots may be either wild caught or be captive bred, though in most areas 
without native parrots, pet parrots are captive bred. Parrot species that are commonly kept 
as pets include conures, macaws, Amazons, cockatoos, African 
Greys, lovebirds,cockatiels, Budgerigars, Eclectus, Caiques, parakeets, Pionus and Poicephalus. Temperaments 
and personalities vary even within a species, just as dog breeds do. Even though African Grey parrots are thought 
to be excellent talkers, not all African Grey parrots want to talk, therefore even though they have the capability to 
do so. Noise level, talking ability, cuddliness with people, and care needs, can sometimes depend on how the bird 
is cared for and the attention he/she regularly receives.
Parrots invariably require an enormous amount of attention, care and intellectual stimulation to thrive, akin to 
that required by a three-year-old child, which many people find themselves unable to provide in the long 
term.[58] Parrots that are bred for pets may be hand fed or otherwise accustomed to interacting with people from a 
young age to help ensure they will be tame and trusting. However, even when hand fed, parrots revert to biting 
and aggression during hormonal surges and if mishandled or neglected. Parrots are not low maintenance pets; 
they require feeding, grooming, veterinary care, training, environmental enrichment through the provision of 
toys, exercise, and social interaction (with other parrots or humans) for good health.
Some large parrot species, including large cockatoos, amazons, and macaws, have very long lifespans, with 80 
years being reported and record ages of over one hundred.[citation needed] Small parrots, such as lovebirds, hanging 
parrots, and budgies have shorter life spans of up to 15-20 years. Some parrot species can be quite loud, and 
many of the larger parrots can be destructive and require a very large cage, and a regular supply of new toys, 
branches, or other items to chew up. The intelligence of parrots means they are quick to learn tricks and other 
behaviours-both good and bad-that get them what they want, such as attention or treats.
The popularity, longevity, and intelligence of many of the larger kinds of pet parrot and their wild traits such as 
screaming, has led to many birds needing to be re-homed during the course of their long lifespans. A common 
problem is that large parrots which are cuddly and gentle as juveniles mature into intelligent, complex, often 
demanding adults that can outlive their owners can also become aggressive and even dangerous. Due to these 
problems, homeless parrots are being euthanised like dogs and cats, and parrot adoption centres and sanctuaries 
are becoming more common. Parrots don't often do well in captivity, causing some parrots to go insane and 
develop repetitive behaviors, such as swaying, screaming, or they become riddled with intense fear. Feather 
destruction and self-mutilation, although not commonly seen in the wild, occur frequently in captivity.
Zoos[edit]

Parrot species are found in most zoos, and a few zoos participate in breeding and conservation programs. Some 
zoos have organized displays of trained parrots and other birds doing tricks.
Trade[edit]
Main article: International parrot trade
 
 
10,000 Hyacinth Macaws were taken from the wild for the pet trade in the 1980s.[59][dead link] As a result Brazil now has only a 
very small number of breeding pairs left in the wild.[citation needed]
The popularity of parrots as pets has led to a thriving-and often illegal-trade in the birds, and some species are 
now threatened with extinction. A combination of trapping of wild birds and damage to parrot habitats makes 
survival difficult or even impossible for some species of parrot. Importation of wild caught parrots into the US 
and Europe is illegal.
The trade continues unabated in some countries. A report published in January 2007 presents a clear picture of 
the wild-caught parrot trade in Mexico, stating: "The majority of parrots captured in Mexico stay in the country 
for the domestic trade. A small percentage of this capture, 4% to 14%, is smuggled into the USA."[60]
The scale of the problem can be seen in the Tony Silva case of 1996, in which a parrot expert and former director 
at Tenerife's Loro Parque (Europe's largest parrot park) was jailed in the United States for 82 months and fined 
$100,000 for smuggling Hyacinth Macaws.[61](Such birds command a very high price). The case led to calls for 
greater protection and control over trade in the birds. Different nations have different methods of handling 
internal and international trade. Australia has banned the export of its native birds since 1960. Following years of 
campaigning by hundreds of NGOs and outbreaks of avian flu, in July 2007, the European Union halted the 
importation of all wild birds with a permanent ban on their import. Prior to an earlier temporary ban started in 
late October 2005, the EU was importing approximately two million live birds a year, about 90% of 
the international market: hundreds of thousands of these were parrots. There are no national laws protecting feral 
parrot populations in the U.S. Mexico has a licensing system for capturing and selling native birds (though the 
laws are not well enforced).
Culture[edit]

Parrots have featured in human writings, story, art, humor, religion and music for thousands of years. 
From Aesop's fable "The parrot and the cat" and the Roman poet Ovid's "The Dead 
Parrot"(Latin), (English) to Monty Python's Dead Parrot Sketch millennia later, parrots have existed in the 
consciousness of many cultures. Recent books about parrots in human culture include Parrot Culture.[62]
In ancient times and current, parrot feathers have been used in ceremonies, and for decoration. The "idea" of the 
parrot has been used to represent the human condition inmedieval literature such as the bestiary. They also have a 
long history as pets.
In Polynesian legend as current in the Marquesas Islands, the hero Laka/Aka is mentioned as having undertaken 
a long and dangerous voyage to Aotona in what are now the Cook Islands, to obtain the highly prized feathers of 
a red parrot as gifts for his son and daughter. On the voyage a hundred out of his 140 rowers died of hunger on 
their way, but the survivors reached Aotona and captured enough parrots to fill 140 bags with their 
feathers.[63][64] By at least some versions, the feathers were plucked off living parrots without killing them.[65]
Currently parrots feature in many media. There are magazines devoted to parrots as pets, and to the conservation 
of parrots.[66]Fictional films include Paulie and Rio, and documentaries include The Wild Parrots of Telegraph 
Hill.
Parrots have also been considered sacred. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped birds and often depicted 
parrots in their art.[67]
Parrots are used as symbols of nations and nationalism. A parrot is found on the flag of Dominica. The St. 
Vincent parrot is the national bird of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a Caribbean nation.
Parrots are popular in Buddhist scripture and there are many writings about them. For example, Amitabha once 
changed itself into a parrot to aid in converting people. Another old story tells how after a forest caught fire, the 
parrot was so concerned it carried water to try and put out the flames. The ruler of heaven was so moved upon 
seeing the parrot's act, that he sent rain to put out the fire. In Chinese Buddhist iconography, a parrot is 
sometimes depicted hovering on the upper right side Guan Yin clasping a pearl or prayer beads in its beak.
Sayings about parrots colour the modern English language. The verb "parroting" can be found in the dictionary, 
and means "to repeat by rote." There are also clichés such as the British expression "sick as a parrot"; although 
this refers to extreme disappointment rather than illness, it may originate from the disease of psittacosis which 
can be passed to humans.[68][69] The first occurrence of a related expression is in Aphra Behn's 1681 play The 
False Count.[70]
Feral populations[edit]
Main article: Feral parrots

Telegraph Hill.
Escaped parrots of several species have become established in the wild outside their natural ranges and in some 
cases outside the natural range of parrots. Among the earliest instances were pet Red Shining-
parrots from Fiji which established a population on the islands of southern Tonga. These introductions were 
prehistoric and Red-shining Parrots were recorded in Tonga by Captain Cook in the 1770s.[26] Escapees first 
began breeding in cities inCalifornia, Texas and Florida in the 1950s (with unproven earlier claims dating back to 
the 1920s in Texas and Florida).[30] They have proved surprisingly hardy in adapting to conditions in Europe and 
North America. They sometimes even multiply to the point of becoming a nuisance or pest, and a threat to local 
ecosystems, and control measures have been used on some feral populations.[71]
Threats and conservation[edit]

Deforestation pushed the Puerto Rican Amazon to the brink of extinction, still remaining among the world's rarest birds 
despite conservation efforts.[72]
Many parrot species are in decline and several are extinct. Of the 350 or so living species, 130 are listed as near 
threatened or worse by theIUCN of which 16 are currently considered Critically Endangered.[73] There are 
several reasons for the decline of so many species, the principal threats being habitat loss and degradation, 
hunting and, for certain species, the wild-bird trade. Parrots are persecuted because, in some areas, they are (or 
have been) hunted for food and feathers, and as agricultural pests. For a time, Argentina offered a bounty 
on Monk Parakeets (an agricultural pest), resulting in hundreds of thousands of birds being killed, though 
apparently this did not greatly affect the overall population.[74]
Capture for the pet trade is a threat to many of the rarer or slower to breed parrots. Habitat loss or degradation, 
most often for agriculture, is a threat to many species. Parrots, being cavity nesters, are vulnerable to the loss of 
nesting sites and to competition with introduced species for those sites. The loss of old trees is a particular 
problem in some areas, particularly in Australia where trees suitable for nesting need to be centuries old. Many 
parrots occur only on islands and are vulnerable to introduced species such as rats andcats, as they lack 
the appropriate anti-predator behaviours needed to deal with mammalian predators. Controlling such predators 
can help in maintaining or increasing the numbers of endangered species.[75] Insular species, which have small 
populations in restricted habitat, are also vulnerable to unpredictable events such as hurricanes and volcanic 
eruptions.
There are many active conservation groups whose goal is the conservation of wild parrot populations. One of the 
largest is the World Parrot Trust,[76] an international organisation. The group gives assistance to worthwhile 
projects as well as producing a magazine[77] and raising funds through donations and memberships, often from 
pet parrot owners. They state they have helped conservation work in 22 countries. On a smaller scale local parrot 
clubs raise money to donate to a conservation cause. Zoo and wildlife centres usually provide public education, 
to change habits that cause damage to wild populations. Recent conservation measures to conserve the habitats of 
some of the high-profile charismatic parrot species has also protected many of the less charismatic species living 
in the ecosystem.[7]A popular attraction that many zoos employ is a feeding station for lories and lorikeets, where 
visitors feed small parrots with cups of liquid food. This is usually done in association with educational signs and 
lectures.
Several projects aimed specifically at parrot conservation have met with success. Translocation of 
vulnerable Kakapo, followed by intensive management and supplementary feeding, has increased the population 
from 50 individuals to 123.[78] In New Caledonia theOuvea Parakeet was threatened by trapping for the pet trade 
and loss of habitat. Community based conservation, which eliminated the threat of poaching, has allowed the 
population to increase from around 600 birds in 1993 to over 2000 birds in 2009.[79]
At present the IUCN recognises 19 species of parrot as extinct since 1600 (the date used to denote modern 
extinctions).[80] This does not include species like the New Caledonian Lorikeet which has not been officially 
seen for 100 years yet is still listed as critically endangered.
Trade, export and import of all wild-caught parrots is regulated and only permitted under special licensed 
circumstances in countries party to CITES, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, 
that came into force in 1975 to regulate the international trade of all endangered wild caught animal and plant 
species. In 1975, 24 parrot species were included on Appendix I of CITES, thus prohibiting commercial 
international trade in these birds. Since that initial listing, continuing threats from international trade led CITES 
to add an additional 32 parrot varieties to Appendix I.[81] All the other parrot species are protected on Appendix II 
of CITES. In addition, individual countries may have laws to regulate trade in certain species.

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris)[2][3] is a 
subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus), a member of 
the Canidae family of the mammalian order Carnivora. The 
term "domestic dog" is generally used for both 
domesticated and feral varieties. The dog was the first 
domesticated animal[4][5] and has been the most widely 
kept working, hunting, and pet animal in human 
history.[citation needed] The word "dog" can also refer 
to the male of a canine species,[6] as opposed to the 
word "bitch" which refers to the female of the species.
Recent studies of "well-preserved remains of a dog-like 
canid from the Razboinichya Cave" in the Altai Mountains 
of southern Siberia concluded that a particular instance 
of early wolf domestication approximately 33,000 years 
ago did not result in modern dog lineages, possibly 
because of climate disruption during the Last Glacial 
Maximum.[4][7] The authors postulate that at least 
several such incipient events have occurred. A study of 
fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia 
tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to 
more than 31,700 years ago.[8] Another recent study has 
found support for claims of dog domestication between 
14,000 and 16,000 years ago, with a range between 9,000 
and 34,000 years ago, depending on mutation rate 
assumptions.[9] Dogs' value to early human hunter-
gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across 
world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such 
as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting 
police and military, companionship, and, more recently, 
aiding handicapped individuals. This impact on human 
society has given them the nickname "man's best friend" 
in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are 
also a source of meat.[10][11] In 2001, there were 
estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[12]
Most breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, 
having been artificially selected for particular 
morphologies and behaviors by people for specific 
functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the 
dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and 
shows more behavioral and morphological variation than 
any other land mammal.[13] For example, height measured 
to the withers ranges from 15.2 centimetres (6.0 in) in 
the Chihuahua to about 76 cm (30 in) in the Irish 
Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually 
called "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to 
dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of 
patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to 
wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[14] It is common 
for most breeds to shed this coat.

Etymology and related terminology

Dog is the common use term that refers to members of the 
subspecies Canis lupus familiaris (canis, "dog"; lupus, 
"wolf"; familiaris, "of a household" or "domestic"). The 
term can also be used to refer to a wider range of 
related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, 
or "true dogs", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, 
or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which 
would also include the African wild dog, or it can be 
used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which 
would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and 
others.[15] Some members of the family have dog in their 
common names, such as the raccoon dog and the African 
wild dog. A few animals have dog in their common names 
but are not canids, such as the prairie dog.
The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, 
from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[16] The 
term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkon, 
represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-
muscle").[17] The word also shows the familiar petname 
diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", 
stagga "stag", wicga "beetle, worm", among others.[18] 
The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest 
layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary, reflecting the 
role of the dog as the earliest domesticated animal.[19]
In 14th-century England, hound (from Old English: hund) 
was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog 
referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the 
mastiff. It is believed this "dog" type was so common, it 
eventually became the prototype of the category 
"hound".[20] By the 16th century, dog had become the 
general word, and hound had begun to refer only to types 
used for hunting.[21] Hound, cognate to German Hund, 
Dutch hond, common Scandinavian hund, and Icelandic 
hundur, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-
European *kwon- "dog", found in Sanskrit kukuur 
(???????),[22] Welsh ci (plural cwn), Latin canis, Greek 
kýon, and Lithuanian uõ.[23]
In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a 
dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English 
bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse 
bikkja). A group of offspring is a litter. The father of 
a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the 
dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or puppies, 
from French poupée, until they are about a year old. The 
process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word 
hwelp (cf. German Welpe, Dutch welp, Swedish valpa, 
Icelandic hvelpur).[24] The term "whelp" can also be used 
to refer to the young of any canid, or as a (somewhat 
archaic) alternative to "puppy".
Taxonomy

In 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, Carl 
Linnaeus, listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar 
to him, the Latin word for dog, canis. Among the species 
within this genus, Linnaeus listed the fox, as Canis 
vulpes, wolves (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, 
(Canis canis). In later editions, Linnaeus dropped Canis 
canis and greatly expanded his list of the Canis genus of 
quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, 
wolves, and jackals and many more terms that are now 
listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including aegyptius 
(hairless dog), aquaticus, (water dog), and mustelinus 
(literally "badger dog"). Among these were two that later 
experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a 
species: Canis domesticus and, most predominantly, Canis 
familiaris, the "common" or "familiar" dog.[25]
The domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own 
right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, 
vocalizations, morphology, and molecular biology led to 
the contemporary scientific understanding that a single 
species, the gray wolf, is the common ancestor for all 
breeds of domestic dogs.[26][27][28] In recognition of 
this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as 
Canis lupus familiaris, a subspecies of the gray wolf 
Canis lupus, by the Smithsonian Institution and the 
American Society of Mammalogists. C. l. familiaris is 
listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in 
the scientific community and recommended by ITIS, 
although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.[29]
Since that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to 
domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, 
Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and Christian Smith in 
1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed 
as taxonomic synonyms for Canis lupus familiaris.[30]
History and evolution



Domestic dogs are descended from gray wolves.
Main articles: Origin of the domestic dog and Gray wolf
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf 
ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with 
complex body language. These sophisticated forms of 
social cognition and communication may account for their 
trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human 
households and social situations, and these attributes 
have given dogs a relationship with humans that has 
enabled them to become one of the most successful species 
on the planet today.[26]
Although experts largely disagree over the details of dog 
domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played 
a significant role in shaping the subspecies.[31] 
Domestication may have occurred initially in separate 
areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. Currently it is 
thought domestication of our current lineage of dog 
occurred sometime as early as 15,000 years ago and 
arguably as late as 8500 years ago. Shortly after the 
latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human 
populations, and spread throughout the world.
Emigrants from Siberia likely crossed the Bering Strait 
with dogs in their company, and some experts[32] suggest 
the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the 
success of the waves that entered North America roughly 
12,000 years ago,[32] although the earliest 
archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North 
America dates from about 9,400 years ago.[33][34] Dogs 
were an important part of life for the Athabascan 
population in North America, and were their only 
domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load 
in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 
years ago. Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures 
often persisted after the introduction of the horse to 
North America.[35]
The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists 
is that the dating of first domestication is 
indeterminate,[31][35] although more recent evidence 
shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 
years ago.[36][37] There is conclusive evidence the 
present lineage of dogs genetically diverged from their 
wolf ancestors at least 15,000 years 
ago,[38][39][40][41][42] but some believe domestication 
to have occurred earlier.[31] Evidence is accruing that 
there were previous domestication events, but that those 
lineages died out.[43]
It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as 
such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or 
whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a 
different course prior to domestication. For example, it 
is hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the 
campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and 
associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored 
those who were less frightened by, and keener in 
approaching, humans.[44]
The bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of 
the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of 
archaeological findings and mitochondrial DNA studies. 
The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based 
in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the 
domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years 
ago,[26][35] and some genetic evidence indicates the 
domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in 
the late Upper Paleolithic close to the 
Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 
years ago.[45] But there is a wide range of other, 
contradictory findings that make this issue 
controversial.[citation needed] There are findings 
beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly 
placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by 
shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding 
of teeth.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the latest point at 
which dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 
15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged 
much earlier.[26] In 2008, a team of international 
scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet 
Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 
31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, musk ox and 
reindeer.[46]
Prior to this Belgian discovery, the earliest dog bones 
found were two large skulls from Russia and a mandible 
from Germany dated from roughly 14,000 years ago.[26][40] 
Remains of smaller dogs from Natufian cave deposits in 
the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human 
being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 
10,000 to 12,000 years ago.[40][47] There is a great deal 
of archaeological evidence for dogs throughout Europe and 
Asia around this period and through the next two thousand 
years (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 years ago), with specimens 
uncovered in Germany, the French Alps, and Iraq, and cave 
paintings in Turkey.[26] The oldest remains of a 
domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and 
have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.[48]
DNA studies


A basenji, one of the earliest domesticated breeds.
DNA studies have provided a wide range of possible 
divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,[40] to 
as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.[49] These 
results depend on a number of assumptions.[26] Genetic 
studies are based on comparisons of genetic diversity 
between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some 
estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an 
estimated wolfcoyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 
years ago as a calibration.[50] If this estimate is 
incorrect, and the actual wolfcoyote divergence is 
closer to one or two million years ago, or more,[51] then 
the DNA evidence that supports specific dogwolf 
divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.
Furthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of 
wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and 
that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by 
selective breeding. This could significantly bias DNA 
analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The 
genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in 
East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. 
These conclusions are based on the location of maximal 
genetic divergence, and assume hybridization does not 
occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. 
Although these assumptions hold for many species, there 
is good reason to believe that they do not hold for 
canines.[26]
Genetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended 
from a handful of domestication events with a small 
number of founding females,[26][45] although there is 
evidence domesticated dogs interbred with local 
populations of wild wolves on several occasions.[40] Data 
suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and 
these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout 
the world, reaching the North American continent around 
8000 BC.[40] The oldest groups of dogs, which show the 
greatest genetic variability and are the most similar to 
their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African 
breeds, including the Basenji, Lhasa Apso, and Siberian 
Husky.[52] Some breeds thought to be very old, such as 
the Pharaoh Hound, Ibizan Hound, and Norwegian Elkhound, 
are now known to have been created more recently.[52]
A great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary 
framework for the domestication of dogs.[26] Although it 
is widely claimed that "man domesticated the wolf,"[53] 
man may not have taken such a proactive role in the 
process.[26] The nature of the interaction between man 
and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and 
controversial. At least three early species of the Homo 
genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years 
ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact 
with canine species.[26]

Despite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of 
canine species to the presence of the close relatives of 
modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, 
roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would 
have coincided with a large expansion in human territory 
and the development of agriculture. This has led some 
biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the 
domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in 
the form of established human settlements. Permanent 
settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of 
disposable food and would have created a barrier between 
wild and anthropogenic canine populations.[26]
In 2013 Thalmann, Krause and coworkers revised the view 
that dog ancestors came from East Asia and showed using 
DNA analysis that "all dogs living today go back to four 
genetic lineages, all of which originate in Europe." [54] 
Their data indicated that bonding between humans and dog 
occurred between 19,000 and 30,000 years ago, likely in 
the context of hunting.[54]

Early roles
Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived 
significant benefits from living in human campsmore 
safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and 
more chance to breed.[55] They would have benefited from 
humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over 
which to see potential predators and prey, as well as 
color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better 
visual discrimination.[55] Camp dogs would also have 
benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down 
larger prey and controlling fire for a range of 
purposes.[55]
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the 
dogs associated with their camps.[56] For instance, dogs 
would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food 
scraps.[56] Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to 
in the Australian Aboriginal expression "three dog night" 
(an exceptionally cold night), and they would have 
alerted the camp to the presence of predators or 
strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early 
warning.[56]
Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit 
would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell 
to assist with the hunt.[56] The relationship between the 
presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often 
mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of 
the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and 
without a dog gives quantitative support to the 
hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was 
an important factor in wolf domestication.[57]
The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly 
improved the chances of survival for early human groups, 
and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the 
key forces that led to human success.[58]
As pets

"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs 
between humans and dogs"[56] and the keeping of dogs as 
companions, particularly by elites, has a long 
history.[59] However, pet dog populations grew 
significantly after World War II as suburbanization 
increased.[59] In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept 
outside more often than they tend to be today[60] (using 
the expression "in the doghouse" to describe exclusion 
from the group signifies the distance between the 
doghouse and the home) and were still primarily 
functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or 
walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been 
changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased 
role of dogs in the emotional support of their human 
guardians.[61] People and dogs have become increasingly 
integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[62] to 
the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family 
and home are experienced.[63]
There have been two major trends in the changing status 
of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of 
the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of 
personality and behaviour.[63] The second has been the 
broadening of the concept of the family and the home to 
include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and 
practices.[63]
There are a vast range of commodity forms available to 
transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[64] The list 
of goods, services and places available is enormous: from 
dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog 
groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, 
spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and 
cemeteries.[64] While dog training as an organized 
activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the 
last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile 
issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, 
jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine 
marking[further explanation needed] became increasingly 
incompatible with the new role of a pet dog.[65] Dog 
training books, classes and television programs 
proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog 
continued.[66]

The majority of contemporary people with dogs describe 
their pet as part of the family,[63] although some 
ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the 
popular reconceptualization of the doghuman family as a 
pack.[63] A dominance model of doghuman relationships 
has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the 
television program Dog Whisperer. However it has been 
disputed that "trying to achieve status" is 
characteristic of doghuman interactions.[67] Pet dogs 
play an active role in family life; for example, a study 
of conversations in doghuman families showed how family 
members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or 
talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions 
with each other.[68]
Another study of dogs' roles in families showed many dogs 
have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, 
the most common of which was helping with the washing-up 
by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in 
the newspaper from the lawn.[63] Increasingly, human 
family members are engaging in activities centered on the 
perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the 
dog is an integral partner, such as Dog Dancing and 
Doga.[64]
According to the statistics published by the American Pet 
Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet 
Owner Survey in 20092010, it is estimated there are 77.5 
million people with pet dogs in the United States.[69] 
The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households 
own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% 
two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not 
seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as 
the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and 
male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are 
undergoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of 
the owned dogs come from a shelter.
The latest study using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
to humans and dogs together proved that dogs have same 
response of voices and use the same parts of brain as 
humans and made dogs understand of emotional human 
voices, made the dogs as friendly social pets to 
humans.[70]
Work
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles 
that they have earned the unique nickname, "man's best 
friend",[71] a phrase used in other languages as well. 
They have been bred for herding livestock,[72] hunting 
(e.g. pointers and hounds),[73] rodent control,[3] 
guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, 
and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as 
companions.[3] In 1957, a husky-terrier mix named Laika 
became the first animal to orbit the Earth.[74][75]

Service dogs such as guide dogs, utility dogs, assistance 
dogs, hearing dogs, and psychological therapy dogs 
provide assistance to individuals with physical or mental 
disabilities.[76][77] Some dogs owned by epileptics have 
been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows 
signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance 
of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, 
medication, or medical care.[78]
Dogs included in human activities in terms of helping out 
humans are usually called working dogs. Dogs of several 
breeds are considered working dogs. Some working dog 
breeds include Akita, Alaskan Malamute, Anatolian 
Shepherd Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Black Russian 
Terrier, Boxer, Bullmastiff, Doberman Pinscher, Dogue de 
Bordeaux, German Pinscher, German Shepherd,[79] Giant 
Schnauzer, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Great Swiss 
Mountain Dog, Komondor, Kuvasz, Mastiff, Neapolitan 
Mastiff, Newfoundland, Portuguese Water Dog, Rottweiler, 
Saint Bernard, Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Standard 
Schnauzer, and Tibetan Mastiff.
Sports and shows
See also: Conformation show
People often enter their dogs in competitions[80] such as 
breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, 
sledding and agility competitions.
In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a 
judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates 
individual purebred dogs for conformity with their 
established breed type as described in the breed 
standard. As the breed standard only deals with the 
externally observable qualities of the dog (such as 
appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested 
qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the 
judging in conformation shows.
As a food source
Main article: Dog meat


Gaegogi (dog meat) stew being served in a Korean 
restaurant
Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, 
including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that 
dates back to antiquity.[81] It is estimated that 1316 
million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every 
year.[82] The BBC claims that, in 1999, more than 6,000 
restaurants served soups made from dog meat in South 
Korea.[83] In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for 
meat, the nureongi (???), differs from those breeds 
raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.[84]
The most popular Korean dog dish is gaejang-guk (also 
called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the 
body's heat during the summer months; followers of the 
custom claim this is done to ensure good health by 
balancing one's gi, or vital energy of the body. A 19th 
century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is 
prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili 
powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo 
shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with 
a segment of the population, dog is not as widely 
consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.[85]
A CNN report in China dated March 2010 includes an 
interview with a dog meat vendor who stated that most of 
the dogs that are available for selling to restaurants 
are raised in special farms but that there is always a 
chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although 
dog pet breeds are not considered edible.[86]
Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian 
Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, 
Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern 
cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as 
taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of 
Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties
being good for the lungs for instance.[87] Dog meat is 
also consumed in some parts of Switzerland.[88]
Health risks to humans
Main article: Dog attack


Pet waste station at a government building.
It is estimated that 4.7 million people are bitten by 
dogs each year.[89] In the 1980s and 1990s the US 
averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this 
has increased to 26.[90] 77% of dog bites are from the 
pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the 
property of the dog's legal owner.[90]
A Colorado study found bites in children were less severe 
than bites in adults.[91] The incidence of dog bites in 
the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 
5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, 
children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the 
face or neck.[92] Sharp claws with powerful muscles 
behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead 
to serious infections.[93]
In the UK between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog 
attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost 
in sick leave.[94]
In the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more 
than 86,000 falls e

Health benefits for humans

A human cuddles a Doberman puppy.
The scientific evidence is mixed as to whether 
companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health 
and psychological wellbeing.[103] Studies suggesting that 
there are benefits to physical health and psychological 
wellbeing[104] have been criticised for being poorly 
controlled,[105] and finding that "[t]he health of 
elderly people is related to their health habits and 
social supports but not to their ownership of, or 
attachment to, a companion animal." Earlier studies have 
shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit 
better mental and physical health than those who do not, 
making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely 
to be on medication than non-guardians.[106]
A 2005 paper states "recent research has failed to 
support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated 
with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced 
use of general practitioner services, or any 
psychological or physical benefits on health for 
community dwelling older people. Research has, however, 
pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school 
through sickness among children who live with pets."[103] 
In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant 
reduction in minor health problems during the first month 
following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained 
in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[107]
In addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more 
physical exercise than those with cats and those without 
pets. The group without pets exhibited no statistically 
significant changes in health or behaviour. The results 
provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive 
effects on human health and behaviour, and that for 
guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-
term.[107] Pet guardianship has also been associated with 
increased coronary artery disease survival, with human 
guardians being significantly less likely to die within 
one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who 
did not own dogs.[108]

team of the 1925 serum run to Nome.
The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with 
dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. 
For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people 
show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and 
psychological indicators of anxiety.[109] Other health 
benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating 
microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene 
hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune 
diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include 
social support, as dogs are able to not only provide 
companionship and social support themselves, but also to 
act as facilitators of social interactions between 
humans.[110] One study indicated that wheelchair users 
experience more positive social interactions with 
strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when 
they are not.[111]
The practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of 
therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals 
were introduced into mental institutions to help 
socialize patients with mental disorders.[112] Animal-
assisted intervention research has shown that animal-
assisted therapy with a dog can increase social 
behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people 
with Alzheimer's disease.[113] One study demonstrated 
that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who 
participated in an education program with dogs and other 
animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge 
and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and 
violent behavior compared to those who were not in an 
animal-assisted program.[114]
Shelters
Main article: Animal shelter
Every year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter 
US animal shelters.[115] The Humane Society of the United 
States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million 
of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the 
United States.[116] However, the percentage of dogs in US 
animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed 
from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased 
since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 
40% among reporting shelters[117] (and many shelters 
reporting 6075%).[118]
Biology

Main article: Dog anatomy


Lateral view of a dog's bone structure.
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia 
for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical 
attributes.[3] Modern dog breeds show more variation in 
size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic 
animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that 
of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.[3] Dogs are 
predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory 
mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, 
a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and 
endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The 
smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that 
stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 
in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 
113 grams (4.0 oz). The largest known dog was an English 
Mastiff which weighed 155.6 kg (343 lb) and was 250 cm 
(98 in) from the snout to the tail.[119] The tallest dog 
is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the 
shoulder.[120]

Vision


Dog's visual colour perception compared with humans.
Like most mammals, dogs are dichromats and have color 
vision equivalent to redgreen color blindness in humans 
(deuteranopia).[121][122][123][124] So, dogs can see blue 
and yellow, but difficult to differentiate red and green 
because dogs only have two spectral types of cones 
photoreceptors, while normal humans have three cones. And 
dogs use color instead of brightness to differentiate 
light or dark blue/yellow.[125] Dogs are less sensitive 
to differences in grey shades than humans and also can 
detect brightness at about half the accuracy of 
humans.[126]
The dog's visual system has evolved to aid proficient 
hunting.[121] While a dog's visual acuity is poor (that 
of a poodle's has been estimated to translate to a 
Snellen rating of 20/75[121]), their visual 
discrimination for moving objects is very high; dogs have 
been shown to be able to discriminate between humans 
(e.g., identifying their human guardian) at a range of 
between 800 and 900 m, however this range decreases to 
500600 m if the object is stationary.[121]
Dogs have a temporal resolution of between 60 and 70 Hz, 
which explains why many dogs struggle to watch 
television, as most such modern screens are optimized for 
humans at 5060 Hz.[126] Dogs can detect a change in 
movement that exists in a single diopter of space within 
their eye. Humans, by comparison, require a change of 
between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.[127][128]
As crepuscular hunters, dogs often rely on their vision 
in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a 
high density of rods in the fovea, an increased flicker 
rate, and a tapetum lucidum.[121] The tapetum is a 
reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light 
to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the 
photons. There is also a relationship between body size 
and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6 
mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% 
variance can be substantial and is associated as an 
adaptation toward superior night vision.[129]
The eyes of different breeds of dogs have different 
shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.[130] Many 
long-nosed breeds have a "visual streak"a wide foveal 
region that runs across the width of the retina and gives 
them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some long-
muzzled breeds, in particular, the sighthounds, have a 
field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). 
Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an "area 
centralis": a central patch with up to three times the 
density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving 
them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some broad-
headed breeds with short noses have a field of vision 
similar to that of humans.[122][123]
Most breeds have good vision, but some show a genetic 
predisposition for myopia  such as Rottweilers, with 
which one out of every two has been found to be 
myopic.[121] Dogs also have a greater divergence of the 
eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their 
pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the 
eye axis of dogs ranges from 1225° depending on the 
breed.[127]
Experimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish 
between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a 
prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images 
such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own 
reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest 
declines sharply once they are unable to make social 
contact with the image.[131]
Hearing


The physiology of a dog ear.


Transformation of the ears of a huskamute puppy in 6 days
The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40 Hz 
to 60,000 Hz,[132] which means that dogs can detect 
sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory 
spectrum.[123][132][133] In addition, dogs have ear 
mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact 
location of a sound.[134] Eighteen or more muscles can 
tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can 
identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, 
as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.[134]
Smell


The wet, textured nose of a dog
While the human brain is dominated by a large visual 
cortex, the dog brain is dominated by an olfactory 
cortex.[121] The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty 
times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative 
to total brain size, with 125 to 220 million smell-
sensitive receptors.[121] The bloodhound exceeds this 
standard with nearly 300 million receptors.[121]
Consequently, it has been estimated that dogs, in 
general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred 
thousand to one million times more sensitive than a 
human's. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the 
olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater 
than a human's.[135] The wet nose, or rhinarium, is 
essential for determining the direction of the air 
current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin 
are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation 
of the moisture by air currents.[136]
Physical characteristics

Coat
Main article: Coat (dog)


A heavy winter coat with countershading in a mixed-breed 
dog
The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" 
being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating 
from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and 
a soft down hair, or "single", with the topcoat only.
Domestic dogs often display the remnants of 
countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A 
countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper 
surfaces and light coloring below,[137] which reduces its 
general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an 
occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on 
their chest or underside.[138]
Tail
See also: Docking
There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, 
straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many 
canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is 
to communicate their emotional state, which can be 
important in getting along with others. In some hunting 
dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid 
injuries.[139] In some breeds, such as the Braque du 
Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no 
tail at all.[140]
Types and breeds

Cavalier King Charles Spaniels demonstrate with-breed 
variation.
While all dogs are genetically very similar,[40] natural 
selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain 
characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving 
rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad 
categories based on function, genetics, or 
characteristics.[141] Dog breeds are groups of animals 
that possess a set of inherited characteristics that 
distinguishes them from other animals within the same 
species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific 
classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.
Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically 
distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds,[52] 
but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is 
unsystematic. Systematic analyses of the dog genome has 
revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said 
to be statistically distinct.[52] These include the "old 
world dogs" (e.g., Malamute and Shar Pei), "Mastiff"-type 
(e.g., English Mastiff), "herding"-type (e.g., Border 
Collie), and "all others" (also called "modern"- or 
"hunting"-type).[52][142]
Health
Main articles: Dog health and CVBD
Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and 
poisons, some of which can affect humans. To defend 
against many common diseases, dogs are often vaccinated.
There are many household plants that are poisonous to 
dogs, such as poinsettias, begonia and aloe vera.[143]
Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments 
such as elbow or hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, 
pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two 
serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs 
are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and 
ages, and bloat, which affects the larger breeds or deep-
chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can 
kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such 
as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworm, 
tapeworm, roundworm, and heartworm.
Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, 
typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is 
toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is 
capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so 
slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, 
especially dark chocolate.
Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health 
conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and 
heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and 
arthritis.[144]
Mortality

Main article: Aging in dogs
The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, 
but for most the median longevity, the age at which half 
the dogs in a population have died and half are still 
alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[145][146][147][148] 
Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their 
breed.
The breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for 
which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable 
sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median 
longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, 
including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish 
Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median 
longevities of 6 to 7 years.[148]
The longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese 
Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median 
longevities of 14 to 15 years.[148] The median longevity 
of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is 
one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when 
all breeds are averaged.[146][147][148][149] The dog 
widely reported to be the longest-lived is "Bluey", who 
died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the 
time of his death; however, the Bluey record is anecdotal 
and unverified.[150] On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the 
world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of 
World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.[151]
Predation
Although wild dogs, like wolves, are apex predators, they 
can be killed in territory disputes with wild 
animals.[152] Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and 
other large predators live, dogs can be a major food 
source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia 
indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill 
sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog 
populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been 
paid for dog losses than livestock.[152] Some wolf pairs 
have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf 
lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal 
waits in ambush.[153] In some instances, wolves have 
displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and 
buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that 
they[which?] have to be beaten off or killed.[154]
Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. 
Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection 
for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them 
regardless of the dog's size or ferocity.[155] Tigers in 
Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed 
to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards.[156] 
Striped Hyenas are major predators of village dogs in 
Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.[157] Reptiles such 
as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat 
dogs.
Diet

Golden Retriever gnawing a pig's foot
Despite their descent from wolves and classification as 
Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and 
other writings as carnivores[158][159] or 
omnivores.[3][160][161][162] Unlike obligate carnivores, 
such as the cat family with its shorter small intestine, 
dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not 
dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level 
of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary 
requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of 
foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a 
large proportion of these in their diet.[3] Compared to 
their wolf ancestors, dogs have adaptations in genes 
involved in starch digestion that contribute to an 
increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[163]
Foods toxic to dogs

(September 2013)
Click [show] on the right to read important instructions 
before translating.[show]
A number of common human foods and household ingestibles 
are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids 
(theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, 
sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[164] grapes and 
raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[165] as well as various 
plants and other potentially ingested 
materials.[166][167] The nicotine in tobacco can also be 
dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or 
ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be 
vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) 
or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of 
coordination, collapse, or death. To solve, soothe the 
stomach irritation by giving charcoal tablets. For severe 
signs, get immediate veterinary attention. [168]
Reproduction
Main article: Canine reproduction
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around 
age six to twelve months for both males and 
females,[3][169] although this can be delayed until up to 
two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at 
which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. 
They will experience subsequent estrous cycles 
biannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. 
At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, 
being mentally and physically receptive to copulation.[3] 
Because the ova survive and are capable of being 
fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for 
a female to mate with more than one male.[3]
25 days post conception fertilization occurs, 1416 days 
embryo attaches to uterus 2223 days heart beat is 
detectable.[170][171]
Dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after 
fertilization,[3][172] with an average of 63 days, 
although the length of gestation can vary. An average 
litter consists of about six puppies,[173] though this 
number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In 
general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in 
each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many 
as twelve.
Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective 
breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French 
Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the 
female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be 
artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.[174]
Neutering

A feral dog from Sri Lanka nursing her four puppies
Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually 
by removal of the male's testicles or the female's 
ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to 
procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the 
overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal 
control agencies, such as the American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that 
dogs not intended for further breeding should be 
neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that 
may have to later be euthanized.[175]
According to the Humane Society of the United States, 34 
million dogs and cats are put down each year in the 
United States and many more are confined to cages in 
shelters because there are many more animals than there 
are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep 
overpopulation down.[176] Local humane societies, SPCAs, 
and other animal protection organizations urge people to 
neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters 
instead of purchasing them.
Neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, 
especially in male dogs.[177] Spayed female dogs are less 
likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary 
glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[178] 
However, neutering increases the risk of urinary 
incontinence in female dogs,[179] and prostate cancer in 
males,[180] as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, 
cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus 
in either sex.[181]
Communication
By the age of four weeks, the dog has developed the 
majority of its vocalizations.[182] The dog is the most 
vocal canid and is unique in its tendency to bark in a 
myriad of situations.[182]
Barking appears to have little more communication 
functions than excitement, fighting, the presence of a 
human, or simply because other dogs are barking.[182] 
Subtler signs such as discreet bodily and facial 
movements, body odors, whines, yelps, and growls are the 
main sources of actual communication.[182] The majority 
of these subtle communication techniques are employed at 
a close proximity to another, but for long-range 
communication only barking and howling are employed.[182]
Intelligence and behavior

Intelligence
Main article: Dog intelligence


The Border Collie is considered to be one of the most 
intelligent breeds.[183]
The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social 
intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.[121] 
Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as 
through simple reinforcement (e.g., classical or operant 
conditioning) and by observation.[121]
Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive 
development. As with humans, the understanding that 
objects not being actively perceived still remain in 
existence (called object permanence) is not present at 
birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact 
intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks 
of age.[121]
Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set 
by experienced dogs.[121] This form of intelligence is 
not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to 
perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract 
problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an 
experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached 
piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the 
cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those 
left to solve the problem on their own.[121][184]
Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one 
study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, 
when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of 
the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with 
the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were 
then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three 
quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, 
and over half successfully released the ball, compared to 
only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human 
manipulate the lever.[185] Another study found that 
handing an object between experimenters who then used the 
object's name in a sentence successfully taught an 
observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to 
subsequently retrieve the item.[186]

participated in four offensives and 17 battles.
Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated social cognition by 
associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.[121] 
One such class of social cognition involves the 
understanding that others are conscious agents. Research 
has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle 
social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or 
dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, 
researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden 
underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then 
attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the 
location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: 
tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to 
the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.[187] The 
results showed that domestic dogs were better than 
chimpanzees, wolves, and human infants at this task, and 
even young puppies with limited exposure to humans 
performed well.[121]
Psychology research has shown that humans' gaze 
instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the 
right side of a person's face, which is related to use of 
right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including 
human facial emotions. Research at the University of 
Lincoln (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when 
meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human 
being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such 
they are the only non-primate species known to do 
so.[188][189]
Stanley Coren, an expert on dog psychology, states that 
these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs 
can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, 
and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition 
that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the 
wolf.[121] Studies have also investigated whether dogs 
engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending 
on the attention-state of their partner.[190] Those 
studies showed that play signals were only sent when the 
dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the 
partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in 
attention-getting behavior before sending a play 
signal.[190]
Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a 
sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, 
which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including 
one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting 
on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the 
room.[121] Although this could have been accidental, 
Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's 
owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of 
view. Together, the empirical data and anecdotal evidence 
points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of 
theory of mind.[121][190] Similar research has been 
performed by Brian Hare of Duke University, who has shown 
that dogs outperform both great apes as well as wolves 
raised by humans in reading human communicative 
signals.[191][192]
A study found a third of dogs suffered from anxiety when 
separated from others.[193]
A border collie named Chaser has learned the names for 
1,022 toys after three years of training, so many that 
her trainers have had to mark the names of the objects 
lest they forget themselves. This is higher than Rico, 
another border collie who could remember at least 200 
objects.[194]
Behavior
Main article: Dog behavior
Although dogs have been the subject of a great deal of 
behaviorist psychology (e.g. Pavlov's dog), they do not 
enter the world with a psychological "blank slate".[121] 
Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as 
well as environmental factors.[121] Domestic dogs exhibit 
a number of behaviors and predispositions that were 
inherited from wolves.[121]
The Gray Wolf is a social animal that has evolved a 
sophisticated means of communication and social 
structure. The domestic dog has inherited some of these 
predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics 
in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective 
breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, 
such as the dog's highly developed social cognition, are 
found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.[187]


Properly socialized dogs can interact with unfamiliar 
dogs of any size and shape and understand how to 
communicate.
The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs 
have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) 
and five consistent and stable "narrow traits" 
identified, described as playfulness, 
curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and 
aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness
boldness was also identified.[195][196]
The average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours 
per day.[197] Like humans, dogs have two main types of 
sleep: Slow-wave sleep, then Rapid eye movement sleep, 
the state in which dreams occur.[198]
Dogs prefer, when they are off the leash and Earth's 
magnetic field is calm, to urinate and defecate with 
their bodies aligned on a north-south axis.[199]
Dog growl
A new study in Budapest, Hungary, has found that dogs are 
able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to 
its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect 
their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie 
about their size, and this is the first time research has 
shown animals can determine another's size by the sound 
it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, 
showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result 
showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of 
the appropriately sized dog first and looked at it 
longest.[200]
Differences from wolves



Some dogs, like this Tamaskan Dog, look very much like 
wolves.
Physical characteristics
Further information: Wolf
Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% 
smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,[201] as well as 
proportionately smaller teeth than other canid 
species.[202] Dogs require fewer calories to function 
than wolves. It is thought by certain experts that the 
dog's limp ears are a result of atrophy of the jaw 
muscles.[202] The skin of domestic dogs tends to be 
thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes 
favoring the former for use as clothing due to its 
greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh 
weather.[202]
Behavioral differences
Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at observational 
learning, being more responsive to instrumental 
conditioning.[202] Feral dogs show little of the complex 
social structure or dominance hierarchy present in wolf 
packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha 
pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members 
to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a 
dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For 
dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in 
locating food items, and are more like competitors.[202]
Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing 
that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor ungulate 
hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations 
where they are sympatric. However, feral dogs have been 
reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the 
Galápagos Islands,[203] and free ranging pet dogs are 
more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.
Domestic dogs can be monogamous.[204] Breeding in feral 
packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a 
dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf 
packs).[205] Male dogs are unusual among canids by the 
fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising 
their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females 
to increase their own reproductive success.[203] Some 
sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other 
large canid species by the fact that they do not 
regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other 
dogs in the same territory.[202]
However, this difference was not observed in all domestic 
dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young 
as well as care for the young by the males has been 
observed in domestic dogs, dingos as well as in other 
feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the 
females and direct choosing of only one mate has been 
observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic 
dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has 
been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.[204][206]
Trainability
Dogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, 
and are, in general, much more responsive to coercive 
techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force 
than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive 
conditioning and rewards.[207] Unlike tame wolves, dogs 
tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.[208]

Mythology
See also category: Mythological dogs
In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as 
watchdogs.[209]
In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog 
who guards the gates of Hades.[209] In Norse mythology, a 
bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim.[209] 
In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the 
Chinvat Bridge.[209] In Philippine mythology, Kimat who 
is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible 
for lightning. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by 
Cwn Annwn.[209]
In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death owns two watch 
dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the 
gates of Naraka.[210]
In Judaism and Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean 
scavengers.[209] In Christianity, dogs represent 
faithfulness.[209] In Asian countries such as China, 
Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind 
protectors.[209] The role of the dog in Chinese mythology 
includes a position as one of the twelve animals which 
cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog).

Synonyms

Felis catus domestica (invalid junior synonym)[5]
The domestic cat[1][2] (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4]) is a small, 
usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. It is often called the 
housecat when kept as an indoor pet,[6] or simply the cat when there is no need 
to distinguish it from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans 
for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.
Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, 
quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small 
prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear 
sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by 
mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other 
mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.
Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication 
includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, 
hissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-
specific body language.[7]
Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and 
shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to 
control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, and the abandonment of former 
household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring 
population control.[8]
Since cats were cult animals in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to 
have been domesticated there,[9] but there may have been instances of 
domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9500 years ago (7500 
BC).[10]
A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from African 
wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BC, in the Near East.[9][11] Cats are 
the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where 
humans live.[12]

The English word cat (Old English catt) is in origin a loanword, introduced to 
many languages of Europe from Latin cattus[14] and Byzantine Greek ??tta, 
including Portuguese and Spanish gato, French chat, German Katze, Lithuanian 
kate and Old Church Slavonic kotka, among others.[15] The ultimate source of the 
word is Afroasiatic, presumably from Late Egyptian caute,[16] the feminine of 
caus "wildcat". The word was introduced, together with the domestic animal 
itself, to the Roman Republic by the 1st century BC.[citation needed] An 
alternative word with cognates in many languages is English puss (pussycat). 
Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from Dutch poes 
or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, 
pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puie and Irish puisín. The 
etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound 
used to attract a cat.[17][18]
A group of cats is referred to as a "clowder" or a "glaring",[19] a male cat is 
called a "tom" or "tomcat"[20] (or a "gib",[21] if neutered), an unaltered 
female is called a "queen",[22] and a pre-pubescent juvenile is referred to as a 
"kitten". Although spayed females have no commonly used name, in some rare 
instances immature or spayed females are referred to as a "molly".[citation 
needed] The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its 
"sire",[23] and its female progenitor is its "dam".[24] In Early Modern English, 
the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[25]
A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization. 
A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same 
breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. 
Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic short-haired or 
domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies 
(chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-
cats.
While the African wildcat is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats 
are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed, there 
are several intermediate stages between domestic pet and pedigree cats on the 
one hand and those entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-feral cat is a 
mostly outdoor cat that is not owned by any one individual, but is generally 
friendly to people and may be fed by several households. Feral cats are 
associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage in 
rubbish, but are typically wary of human interaction.[13]
Taxonomy and evolution

Main article: Cat evolution


The wildcat, Felis silvestris, is the ancestor of the domestic cat.
The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor 
only 1015 million years ago,[26] and include, in addition to the domestic cat, 
lions, tigers, cougars, and many others. Within this family, domestic cats 
(Felis catus) are part of the genus Felis, which is a group of small cats 
containing approximately seven species (depending upon classification 
scheme).[1][27] Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle 
cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris 
silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. 
bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.[28]
All the cats in this genus share a common ancestor that probably lived around 6
7 million years ago in Asia.[29] The exact relationships within the Felidae are 
close but still uncertain,[30][31] e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes 
classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the 
wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.[4][30] As domestic cats 
are little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed. This 
hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of wildcat 
populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, and possibly also the Iberian 
Peninsula.[32]
The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carolus Linnaeus in the 
tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758.[1][3] However, because of modern 
phylogenetics, domestic cats are now usually regarded as another subspecies of 
the wildcat, Felis silvestris.[1][4][33] This has resulted in mixed usage of the 
terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis 
silvestris catus.[1][4][33] Wildcats have also been referred to as various 
subspecies of F. catus,[33] but in 2003 the International Commission on 
Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris.[34] The 
most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus, following a 
convention for domesticated animals of using the earliest (the senior) synonym 
proposed.[34] Sometimes the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus[35] or 
Felis domestica,[1] as proposed by German naturalist J. C. P. Erxleben in 1777, 
but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in 
scientific literature,[36] because Linnaeus's binomial takes precedence.[37]
Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans. However, 
in comparison to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the 
domestication process, as the form and behavior of the domestic cat are not 
radically different from those of wildcats, and domestic cats are perfectly 
capable of surviving in the wild.[38][39] This limited evolution during 
domestication means that domestic cats tend to interbreed freely with wild 
relatives,[32] distinguishing them from other domesticated animals.[citation 
needed] Fully domesticated house cats also often interbreed with feral F. catus 
populations.[13] However, several natural behaviors and characteristics of 
wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets.[39] These traits 
include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, 
and relatively high intelligence;[40]:1217 they may also have an inborn 
tendency towards tameness.[39]
There are two main theories about how cats were domesticated. In one, people 
deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection, as they were 
useful predators of vermin.[41] However, this has been criticized as 
implausible, because there may have been little reward for such an effort: cats 
generally do not carry out commands and, although they do eat rodents, other 
species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests.[4] 
The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually 
diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to 
hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.[4]
There is a population of Transcaucasian Black feral cats once classified as 
Felis daemon (Satunin, 1904), but now this population is considered to be a part 
of domestic cat.[42]
Genetics

Main article: Cat genetics
The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms 
that possess 38 chromosomes[43] and roughly 20,000 genes.[44] About 250 
heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human 
inborn errors.[45] The high level of similarity among the metabolisms of mammals 
allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that 
were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as 
animal models in the study of the human diseases.[46][47]
Anatomy

Main article: Cat anatomy


Diagram of the general anatomy of a male
Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, 
typically weighing between 45 kg (8.811.0 lb).[30] However, some breeds, such 
as the Maine Coon, can occasionally exceed 11 kg (25 lb). Conversely, very small 
cats (less than 1.8 kg (4.0 lb)) have been reported.[48] The world record for 
the largest cat is 21.3 kg (47 lb).[49] The smallest adult cat ever officially 
recorded weighed around 1.36 kg (3.0 lb).[49] Feral cats tend to be lighter as 
they have more limited access to food than house cats. In the Boston area, the 
average feral adult male will scale 3.9 kg (8.6 lb) and average feral female 3.3 
kg (7.3 lb).[50] Cats average about 2325 cm (910 in) in height and 46 cm (18.1 
in) in head/body length (males being larger than females), with tails averaging 
30 cm (11.8 in) in length.[51]
Cats have seven cervical vertebrae as do almost all mammals; 13 thoracic 
vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three 
sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five because of their bipedal 
posture); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans retain 
three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[52]:11 The extra 
lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and 
flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the 
pelvis.[52] :16 Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by 
free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any 
space into which they can fit their heads.[53]


Cat skull
The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a 
powerful and specialized jaw.[54]:35 Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for 
killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a 
lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of 
the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible 
paralysis and death.[55] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly 
spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small 
rodents, which have small vertebrae.[55] The premolar and first molar together 
compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears 
meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, 
since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively.[54]:37
Cats, like dogs, are digitigrades. They walk directly on their toes, with the 
bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.[56] Cats are 
capable of walking very precisely, because like all felines they directly 
register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of 
the corresponding forepaw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also 
provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. 
Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" gait; that is, they 
move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. 
This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, 
a cat's gait will change to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other 
mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite 
hind and forelegs will move simultaneously.[57]
Like almost all members of the Felidae family, cats have protractable and 
retractable claws.[58] In their normal, relaxed position the claws are sheathed 
with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by 
preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of 
prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hind 
feet.[59] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may 
extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra 
traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and 
four on their rear paws.[60] The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to 
the other claws. More proximally, there is a protrusion which appears to be a 
sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the 
wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and of dogs. It 
has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an anti-skidding device 
used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and 
claws).[60] These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North 
America.[61]
Physiology

Normal physiological values[62]:330
Body temperature	38.6 °C (101.5 °F)
Heart rate	120140 beats per minute
Breathing rate	1640 breaths per minute
As cats are familiar and easily kept animals, their physiology has been 
particularly well studied; it generally resembles that of other carnivorous 
mammals but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' 
descent from desert-dwelling species.[35] For instance, cats are able to 
tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable 
when their skin temperature passes about 38 °C (100 °F), but cats show no 
discomfort until their skin reaches around 52 °C (126 °F),[54]:46 and can 
tolerate temperatures of up to 56 °C (133 °F) if they have access to water.[63]
Cats conserve heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin and lose heat by 
evaporation through their mouth. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands 
located primarily in their paw pads,[64] and pant for heat relief only at very 
high temperatures[65] (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body 
temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack 
of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the 
day and at night.[66]:1 Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is 
highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations that allow cats to retain as 
much fluid as possible.[35] Their kidneys are so efficient that cats can survive 
on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water,[67] and can even 
rehydrate by drinking seawater.[66]:29[68]
Cats are obligate carnivores: their physiology has evolved to efficiently 
process meat, and they have difficulty digesting plant matter.[35] In contrast 
to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, 
about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein.[35] Cats are unusually dependent on a 
constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes 
marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal.[69] Another unusual feature is that 
the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular 
degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible 
blindness.[35] Since cats tend to eat all of their prey, they obtain minerals by 
digesting animal bones, and a diet composed only of meat may cause calcium 
deficiency.[35]
A cat's gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating, being much shorter 
than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes 
that are needed to digest carbohydrates.[70] These traits severely limit the 
cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain 
fatty acids.[70] Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian 
or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically 
synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. 
However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients that 
cats require,[71] and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of 
causing severe nutritional deficiencies.[72]
Cats do eat grass occasionally. Proposed explanations include that grass is a 
source of folic acid or dietary fiber.[73]
Senses

Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one sixth the light level 
required for human vision.[54]:43 This is partly the result of cat eyes having a 
tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back 
into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.[74] Another 
adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, 
such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils.[75] These slit pupils can focus 
bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic 
cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big 
cats.[75] Indeed, at low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most 
of the exposed surface of its eyes.[76] However, domestic cats have rather poor 
color vision and (like most non-primate mammals) have only two types of cones, 
optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability 
to distinguish between red and green.[77] A 1993 paper found a response to mid-
wavelengths from a system other than the rods which might be due to a third type 
of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather 
than representing true trichromatic vision.[78]
Cats have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of 
frequencies. They can hear higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, 
detecting frequencies from 55 Hz up to 79 kHz, a range of 10.5 octaves; while 
humans can only hear from 31 Hz up to 18 kHz, and dogs hear from 67 Hz to 44 
kHz, which are both ranges of about 9 octaves.[79][80] Cats do not use this 
ability to hear ultrasound for communication but it is probably important in 
hunting,[81] since many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls.[82] Cat 
hearing is also extremely sensitive and is among the best of any mammal,[79] 
being most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz.[83] This sensitivity is 
further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which 
both amplify sounds and help a cat sense the direction from which a noise is 
coming.[81]


Cats' whiskers are highly sensitive to touch.
Cats have an acute sense of smell, which is due in part to their well-developed 
olfactory bulb and also to a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square 
centimetres (0.90 sq in) in area, which is about twice that of humans and only 
1.7-fold less than the average dog.[84] Cats are very sensitive to pheromones 
such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,[85] which they use to communicate through 
urine spraying and marking with scent glands.[86] Cats also respond strongly to 
plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that 
substance at less than one part per billion.[87] This response is also produced 
by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; 
it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and 
stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.[88]
Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans. Domestic and wild cats 
share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary 
molecules like carbohydrates, leaving them with no ability to taste 
sweetness.[89] Their taste buds instead respond to amino acids, bitter tastes 
and acids.[90]
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable vibrissae 
(whiskers) over their body, especially their face. These provide information on 
the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching 
objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink 
reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.[54]:47
Health

Main article: Cat health
The average life expectancy for male indoor cats at birth is around 12 to 14 
years,[91] with females usually living a year or two longer.[92] However, there 
have been reports of cats reaching into their 30s,[93] with the oldest known 
cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.[94] Feline life expectancy has 
increased significantly in recent decades.[95] Having a cat neutered confers 
some health benefits, since castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, 
spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced 
risk of mammary cancer.[96] The lifespan of feral cats is hard to determine 
accurately, although one study reported a median age of 4.7 years, with a range 
between 0 to 8.3 years.[97]
Diseases
Cats can suffer from a wide range of health problems, including infectious 
diseases, parasites, injuries and chronic disease. Vaccinations are available 
for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to 
eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.
Poisoning
In addition to obvious dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides and 
herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals that are usually considered 
safe by their human guardians.[98] This is because their livers are less 
effective at some forms of detoxification than those of many other animals, 
including humans and dogs.[35][99] Some of the most common causes of poisoning 
in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits.[100] It has also been suggested that 
cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants.[98][101] When a 
cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause, it is 
possible that it has been exposed to a toxin.
Many human medicines should never be given to cats. For example, the painkiller 
paracetamol (also called acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is 
extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can 
be fatal.[102][103] Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in 
cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans[103] and must be administered 
cautiously.[98] Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of 
cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter 
loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal.[104] Essential oils can be toxic to cats 
and there have been reported cases of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, 
including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.[105]
Other common household substances that should be used with caution around cats 
include mothballs and other naphthalene products.[98] Phenol-based products 
(e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol (Lysol) or hexachlorophene)[98] are often used for 
cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or litter boxes but these can 
sometimes be fatal.[106] Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive 
antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and as little as a teaspoonful 
can be fatal.[107] Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can 
cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat 
chocolate.[108] Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to 
cats.[98] Many houseplants are also dangerous,[109] such as Philodendron species 
and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause 
permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.[110]
Behavior

See also: Cat behavior, Cat communication, and Cat intelligence
Free-ranging cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be 
slightly more active at night.[111][112] The timing of cats' activity is quite 
flexible and varied, which means that house cats may be more active in the 
morning and evening (crepuscular behavior), as a response to greater human 
activity at these times.[113] Although they spend the majority of their time in 
the vicinity of their home, housecats can range many hundreds of meters from 
this central point, and are known to establish territories that vary 
considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17 to 69 
acres).[112]
Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow 
older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually 1216 hours, with 1314 being 
the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours in a 24-hour period. The 
term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep 
(lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of 
rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests 
that they are dreaming.[114]
Sociability


Social grooming in a pair
Although wildcats are solitary, the social behavior of domestic cats is much 
more variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies 
that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating 
females.[115][116] Within such groups one cat is usually dominant over the 
others.[36] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually 
active males having the largest territories, which are about ten times larger 
than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories.[86] 
These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head 
height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.[86] Between these 
territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without 
territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually 
chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if 
that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats 
cohabiting in colonies, cats do not have a social survival strategy, or a pack 
mentality and always hunt alone.[117]
Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, 
trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of 
meowing.[7] By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.[118]:208 Their types 
of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of whole body, 
and kneading of paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are 
particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats,[119][120] e.g. with a 
raised tail acting as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicating 
hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social 
hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than 
subordinate animals.[120] Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and 
may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats 
raising and tilting its head.[116]

However, some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats may show 
aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which may include biting and 
scratching; this type of behavior is known as Feline Asocial Aggression.[121]
Even though cats and dogs are believed to be natural enemies, they can live 
together if correctly socialized.[122]
For cats, life in proximity to humans and other animals kept by them amounts to 
a symbiotic social adaptation. They may express great affection towards their 
human (and even other) companions, especially if they psychologically imprint on 
them at a very young age and are treated with consistent affection.[citation 
needed] It has been suggested that, ethologically, the human keeper of a cat 
functions as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother,[citation needed] and that 
adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood,[123] a form 
of behavioral neoteny. It has even been theorized[124] that the high-pitched 
sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human 
infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.
Grooming


The hooked papillae on a cat's tongue act like a hairbrush to help clean and 
detangle fur.
Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their 
coats.[125] The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers 
long, which are called papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain 
keratin.[126] These spines allow cats to groom themselves by licking their fur, 
with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush. Some cats, particularly 
longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected 
in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped 
and about two to three centimeters long. Hairballs can be prevented with 
remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular 
grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.[125] Some cats can develop a 
compulsive behavior known as psychogenic alopecia, or excessive 
grooming.[127][clarification needed]
Fighting
Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.[128] Among 
feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two 
males to mate with a female. In such cases, most fights will be won by the 
heavier male.[129] Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the 
difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.[128] Female cats 
will also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will 
decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior 
is linked to sex hormones.[citation needed]


Cats intimidate opponents by arching their backs, raising their fur, turning 
sideways, and hissing.
When fighting, cats make themselves appear more impressive and threatening by 
raising their fur, arching their backs, and turning sideways, thus increasing 
their apparent size.[119] Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid 
damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while 
focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort 
to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and 
delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as 
bites. Cats will also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to 
rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.[130]
Serious damage is rare as the fights are usually short in duration, with the 
loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. 
However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may 
include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from 
fighting will be limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can 
occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main 
route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).[131] Sexually 
active males will usually be involved in many fights during their lives, and 
often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to the ears and 
nose.
Hunting and feeding


A cat that has caught a mouse.
Cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents,[132] and are often used as a 
form of pest control.[133][134] Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife 
in the United States killing an estimated 1.43.7 billion birds and 6.920.7 
billion mammals annually.[135][136] The bulk of the predation the United States 
is done by 80 million feral and stray cats. Effective measures to reduce this 
population are elusive, meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts.[135][136] In 
the case of free ranging pets, equipping cats with bells and not letting them 
out at night will reduce wildlife predation.[132] Feral cats and house cats that 
are free-fed tend to consume many small meals in a single day, although the 
frequency and size of meals varies between individuals.[117] Cats use two 
hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an 
animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the type 
of strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with for example, 
cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk 
birds.[137]:153
Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or 
perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which 
to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from such a perch as a tree 
branch, as does a leopard.[138][clarification needed] Other possible 
explanations include that height gives the cat a better observation point, 
allowing it to survey its territory. During a fall from a high place, a cat can 
reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and 
flexibility.[139][clarification needed] This is known as the cat righting 
reflex. An individual cat always rights itself in the same way, provided it has 
the time to do so, during a fall. The height required for this to occur is 
around 90 cm (3 feet). Cats without a tail (e.g. Manx cats) also have this 
ability, since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of 
angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is in fact little used for 
this feat.[140] This leads to the proverb "a cat always lands on its feet".
One poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of 
prey to human guardians. Ethologist Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt 
humans into their social group, and share excess kill with others in the group 
according to the local pecking order, in which humans are placed at or near the 
top.[141] Anthropologist and zoologist Desmond Morris, in his 1986 book 
Catwatching, suggests that when cats bring home mice or birds, they are 
attempting to teach their human to hunt, or trying to help their human as if 
feeding "an elderly cat, or an inept kitten".[142][clarification needed] 
Morris's theory is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home 
prey, despite males having no involvement with raising kittens.[137]:153
Domestic cats select food based on its temperature, smell and texture, strongly 
disliking chilled foods and responding most strongly to moist foods rich in 
amino acids, which are similar to meat.[72][117] Cats may reject novel flavors 
(a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted 
unpleasant in the past.[117] They may also avoid sugary foods and milk; since 
they are lactose intolerant, these sugars are not easily digested and may cause 
soft stools or diarrhea.[117][143] They can also develop odd eating habits. Some 
cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, 
paper, string, aluminum foil/Christmas tree tinsel, or even coal. This condition 
is called pica and can threaten their health, depending on the amount and 
toxicity of the items eaten.[144][145]
Since cats cannot fully close their lips around something to create suction, 
they use a lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their 
mouths. Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip 
of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it, drawing 
water upwards.[146]
Play
Main article: Cat play and toys
File:Play fight between cats.webmhd.webm 

Play fight between kittens, age 14 weeks.
Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. This 
behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, 
capture, and kill prey.[147] Cats will also engage in play fighting, with each 
other and with humans. This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the 
skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate 
with launching attacks on other animals.[148]
Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with 
objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but 
rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with 
before.[149] Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.[150] 
String is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten it can become caught at the 
base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency 
which can cause serious illness, even death.[151] Owing to the risks posed by 
cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which 
cats may chase.[152] While concerns have been raised about the safety of these 
lasers, John Marshall, an ophthalmologist at St Thomas' Hospital, has stated 
that it would be "virtually impossible" to blind a cat with a laser 
pointer.[153][clarification needed]
Reproduction


When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she 
assumes a position conducive to mating known as lordosis behavior.
See also: Kitten
Female cats are seasonally polyestrous, which means they may have many periods 
of heat over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in 
late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 
days.[154] Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will 
fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will 
reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The 
female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a 
male cat's penis has a band of about 120150 backwards-pointing penile spines, 
which are about one millimeter long;[155] upon withdrawal of the penis, the 
spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which is a trigger for ovulation. 
This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a 
second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of 
conception.[citation needed]
After mating, the female will wash her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts to 
mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 
minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.[154]
Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be 
impregnated by the first male with which they mate.[156] Furthermore, cats are 
superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in 
heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different 
fathers.[154]
