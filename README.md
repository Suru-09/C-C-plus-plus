# Basic algorithms in C\C++


## Backtracking

```
1) Queens Problem
2) Sudoku
3) Knight Problem
4) Maze
5) Coins Problem
```
## Bits
```
1) Creating a bitmap image
      - encrypting a text in it
      - creating gradients
```
## GeneralAlgorithms

```
1) Fibonacci in log2(N)
        - realized using matrix multiplication
```
## Graphs

```
1) Algorithm Data and Analysis Project: Index File System
   * Using persistent B-Trees in order to create an indexing file
   * This indexes are create based on a data file given
```

```
2) Algorithm Data and Analysis Project: Compression Tool
   * Using Huffman tree method
```


## InfoArena

```
1) 'Iepuri'
      - matrix multiplication, quite alike to fibonacci in log2(n) time
```
